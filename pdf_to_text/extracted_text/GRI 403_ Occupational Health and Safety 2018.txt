Introduction
GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their
occupational health and safety-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains seven disclosures, which provide information about how the organization manages its
occupational health and safety-related impacts.
• Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s occupational health and
safety-related impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing
this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of occupational health and safety.
Healthy and safe work conditions are recognized as a human right and addressed in authoritative intergovernmental
instruments, including those of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD), and the World Health Organization (WHO): see the Bibliography.
Healthy and safe work conditions are also a target of the Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by the United
Nations (UN) as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.1
Healthy and safe work conditions involve both prevention of physical and mental harm, and promotion of workers’
health.
Prevention of harm and promotion of health require an organization to demonstrate commitment to workers' health
and safety. They also require the organization to engage workers in the development, implementation, and
performance evaluation of an occupational health and safety policy, management system and programs that are
appropriate to the organization’s size and activities.
It is essential that workers are consulted in the development of an organization’s occupational health and safety
policy, and participate in the processes necessary to plan, support, operate, and continually evaluate the effectiveness
of the occupational health and safety management system and programs.
Hazard identification and risk assessment, worker training, and incident identification and investigation are also key to
planning, supporting, operating, and evaluating the occupational health and safety management system.
In addition to preventing harm, an organization can promote workers’ health by offering healthcare services or
voluntary health promotion services and programs, which, for example, help workers improve their diet or quit
smoking. These additional services and programs cannot serve as a substitute for occupational health and safety
programs, services and systems that prevent harm and protect workers from work-related injuries and ill health.
All services and programs that aim to prevent harm and promote workers’ health are expected to respect workers’
right to privacy. Organizations are expected not to use workers' participation in such services and programs, or the
health data derived therefrom, as criteria for their decisions regarding employment or engagement of workers,
including termination, demotion, promotion or offering of prospects, compensation, or any other favorable or
unfavorable treatment.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
1 See Target 8.8: ‘Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular
women migrants, and those in precarious employment’, within Goal 8: ‘Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and
productive employment and decent work for all’. Other Sustainable Development Goals are also relevant to the topic of occupational health and
safety, for example Goal 3: ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’.
5 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its occupational health and safety-related impacts.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined occupational health and safety to be a material topic:
6 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s occupational health and safety-
related impacts (Disclosure 403-1 through Disclosure 403-10).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
Scope of ‘workers’ in this Standard
7 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
Scope of ‘workers’ in this Standard
In the context of the GRI Standards, the term ‘worker’ is defined as a person that performs work. Some GRI Standards
specify the use of a particular subset of workers.
This Standard covers the following subset of workers, for whose occupational health and safety an organization is
expected to be responsible:
• All workers who are employees (i.e., those workers who are in an employment relationship with the organization
according to national law or practice);
• All workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization;
• All workers who are not employees and whose work and workplace are not controlled by the organization, but the
organization’s operations, products, or services are directly linked to significant occupational health and safety
impacts on those workers by its business relationships.
See Table 1 for examples of employees and workers who are not employees according to the criteria of ‘control of
work’ and ‘control of workplace’.
When the reporting organization does not have data available for all the workers specified in a disclosure, the
organization is required to identify the types of worker excluded from the disclosures and explain why they have been
excluded. See also Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for requirements on reasons for omission.
Workers who are employees
All employees are to be included by the organization in its reported data, regardless of whether the organization
controls their work and/or workplace.
For employees, the organization is required to report the topic management disclosures (except Disclosure 403-7)
and the topic disclosures.
Workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization
Workers who are not employees might include agency workers, contractors, self-employed persons, and volunteers,
among other types of worker. Workers who are not employees might include those working for the organization, or for
the organization’s suppliers, customers, or other business partners.
Note that the worker type does not determine whether the worker is to be included by the organization in its reported
data. Workers, of any type, are to be included if the organization controls their work and/or workplace, because these
forms of control position the organization to take action to eliminate hazards and minimize risks, to protect workers
from harm.
Control of work implies that the organization has control over the means or methods, or directs the work performed
with respect to its occupational health and safety performance. Control of workplace implies that the organization has
control over the physical aspects of the workplace (e.g., access to the workplace), and/or the type of activities that can
be performed in the workplace.
The organization might have sole control of the work and/or workplace, or share control with one or more
organizations (e.g., suppliers, customers, or other business partners, such as in joint ventures). In cases of shared
control, workers of the organization’s business partner are to be included in the reported data when there is a
contractual obligation between the organization and the partner, and the organization shares control over the means
or methods, or shares direction of the work performed, and/or over the workplace. In such cases, through contractual
obligation, the organization can require the partner to, for example, use a less harmful chemical in its products or
production process.
For workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, the
organization is required to report the topic management disclosures (except Disclosure 403-7) and the topic
disclosures.
Workers who are not employees and whose work and workplace are not controlled by the organization, but the
organization’s operations, products, or services are directly linked to significant occupational health and safety
impacts on those workers by its business relationships
An organization is expected to be responsible for the occupational health and safety of employees and of workers who
are not employees but whose work and/or workplace it controls. Beyond that, an organization might also be involved
with occupational health and safety impacts as a result of its business relationships with other entities, such as
entities in its value chain.
8 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
In cases where an organization has no control over both the work and workplace, it still has a responsibility to make
efforts, including exercising any leverage it might have, to prevent and mitigate negative occupational health and safety
impacts that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its business relationships.
In these cases, the organization is required, at a minimum, to describe its approach to preventing and mitigating
significant negative occupational health and safety impacts and the related hazards and risks, using Disclosure 403-
7 in the Topic management disclosures section.

1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined occupational health and safety to be a material topic is required to report how it
manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section). The
organization is also required to report any disclosures from this section (Disclosure 403-1 through Disclosure 403-7)
that are relevant to its occupational health and safety-related impacts.
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages occupational health and
REQUIREMENTS
safety using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
1.2 The reporting organization should report any other leading indicators or measures used
RECOMMENDATIONS
to inform the management and evaluation of the occupational health and safety
performance.
If the operations of the reporting organization span a large number of countries or sites, it may
GUIDANCE
group the topic management disclosures across countries or sites by relevant categories. For
example, the organization may group information required in Disclosure 403-4-b on formal joint
management-worker health and safety committees across sites with similar characteristics
together; it does not have to report on each committee separately.
Guidance for clause 1.2
Leading indicators measure an organization’s performance in relation to the actions it takes to
prevent work-related injuries and ill health. They are important because organizations cannot
rely solely on lagging indicators, which might not give a true picture of their occupational health
and safety performance due to issues such as long-latency ill health and underreporting.
Leading indicators are often unique or tailored to a specific organization. Examples of such
indicators include the number of workers trained in hazard identification and incident reporting,
the increase in reporting of hazards and incidents after implementation of reporting policy and
processes and worker training, the frequency of health and safety inspections or audits, the
average time it takes to implement the recommendations of an inspection or audit, and
response times for the investigation and elimination of hazards.

corrective actions using the hierarchy of controls, and to determine improvements
needed in the occupational health and safety management system.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-2-a
GUIDANCE
When describing the processes used to identify hazards and assess risks on a routine and
non-routine basis, and to apply the hierarchy of controls, the reporting organization can:
• specify whether these processes are based on legal requirements and/or recognized
standards/guidelines;
• describe the frequency and scope of processes undertaken on a routine basis;
• describe the triggers for processes undertaken on a non-routine basis, such as changes in
operating procedures or equipment; incident investigations; worker complaints or referrals;
changes in workers or workflow; results of surveillance of work environment and worker
health, including exposure monitoring (e.g., exposure to noise, vibration, dust);
• explain how obstacles to the implementation of these processes are removed for workers
who might be more vulnerable to the risk of work-related injury or ill health, such as workers
facing language barriers or having visual or hearing impairments (e.g., by providing
occupational health and safety training and information in a language easily understood by
workers).
Guidance for Disclosures 403-2-b and 403-2-c
Protecting workers against reprisals involves putting policies and processes in place that
provide them with protection against intimidation, threats, or acts that could have a negative
impact on their employment or work engagement, including termination, demotion, loss of
compensation, discipline, and any other unfavorable treatment. Workers might face reprisals on
account of their decision to either remove themselves from work situations that they believe
could cause injury or ill health, or for reporting hazards or hazardous situations to their workers’
representatives, to their employer, or to regulatory authorities.
Disclosure 403-2-c covers the right of workers to refuse or stop unsafe or unhealthy work.
Workers have the right to remove themselves from work situations that they believe could cause
them or another person injury or ill health.
12 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
Disclosure 403-3 Occupational health services
The reporting organization shall report the following information for employees and for
REQUIREMENTS
workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the
organization:

identification and elimination of hazards and minimization of risks, and an explanation
of how the organization ensures the quality of these services and facilitates workers’
access to them.
1.3 The reporting organization should report the following additional information:
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.3.1 How the organization maintains the confidentiality of workers’ personal health-
related information;
1.3.2 How the organization ensures that workers’ personal health-related information
and their participation in any occupational health services is not used for any
favorable or unfavorable treatment of workers.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-3
GUIDANCE
Occupational health services aim to protect the health of workers in relation to their work
environment.
When describing how the quality of occupational health services is ensured, the reporting
organization can explain whether the services are provided by competent individuals with
recognized qualifications and accreditations, and whether it complies with legal requirements
and/or recognized standards/guidelines.
When describing how it facilitates workers’ access to occupational health services, the
organization can describe whether it provides these services at the workplace and during
working hours; whether it arranges transport to health clinics or expedites service there; whether
it provides information about the services, including in a language easily understood by workers;
and whether it adjusts workloads to allow workers to make use of these services.
The organization can also report the metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of these
services, and the approaches used to raise awareness about them and encourage
participation.
Guidance for clauses 1.3.1 and 1.3.2
Occupational health services are expected to respect workers’ right to privacy. Organizations are
expected not to use workers' participation in such services and programs, or the health data
derived therefrom, as criteria for their decisions regarding the employment or engagement of
workers, including termination, demotion, promotion or offering of prospects, compensation, or
any other favorable or unfavorable treatment. See reference [6] in the Bibliography.

whether and, if so, why any workers are not represented by these committees.
1.4 The reporting organization should report whether and, if so, which occupational health
RECOMMENDATIONS
and safety topics are covered in local or global formal agreements with trade unions.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-4-a
GUIDANCE
When describing the processes for worker participation in occupational health and safety, the
reporting organization can include information on:
• formal participation, based on legal requirements;
• participation through engagement with formally recognized workers’ representatives;
• direct participation, particularly by affected workers (e.g., the direct involvement of all workers
in occupational health and safety decisions in small organizations);
• the use of committees, and how these committees are established and operated;
• participation in the occupational health and safety management system (e.g., participation in
identification of hazards, assessment of risks, application of the hierarchy of controls,
investigation of incidents, audits, decision-making about the use of contractors and
outsourcing);
• how obstacles to participation are identified and removed (e.g., by providing training, by
protecting workers against reprisals).
When describing the processes for providing access to and communicating relevant information
on occupational health and safety to workers, the organization can report whether it provides
information about work-related incidents and the actions taken in response.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-4-b
A common form of worker participation in occupational health and safety is through joint
management-worker health and safety committees. In addition to direct participation of workers
from all job levels in these committees, workers’ representatives, where they exist, might also
be involved in these joint activities, as they might be authorized to make decisions about
occupational health and safety, among other workplace decisions.
Where formal joint management-worker health and safety committees exist, the organization
can also describe the level at which each committee operates within the organization, its
dispute resolution mechanism, its chairing responsibilities, and how the committee members
are protected against reprisals.
Disclosure 403-4-b requires a description of whether and, if so, why any workers are not
represented by these committees. It does not require information on which workers are or are
not members of such committees.
Guidance for clause 1.4
Agreements at the local level typically include topics such as provision of personal protective
equipment; participation of workers’ representatives in health and safety inspections, audits,
and incident investigations; provision of training and education; and protection against reprisals.
Agreements at the global level typically include topics such as compliance with the ILO’s
International Labour Standards; arrangements or structures for resolving problems; and
commitments regarding occupational health and safety standards and levels of performance.

1.5.2 How the organization ensures that workers’ personal health-related information
and their participation in any services or programs is not used for any favorable or
unfavorable treatment of workers.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-6-a
GUIDANCE
Achieving universal health coverage, including financial risk protection; access to quality
essential healthcare services; and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential
medicines and vaccines for all, is one of the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals
(Target 3.8).
Workers’ access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services might be facilitated, for
example, through company clinics or disease treatment programs, referral systems, or health
insurance or financial contributions.
When describing the scope of access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services
provided, the reporting organization can specify the types of service to which access is facilitated
and the types of worker that have access to them.
If the organization does not facilitate workers’ access to non-occupational medical and
healthcare services because it operates in a country where the population already has access
to high-quality and accessible services (e.g., through financial or other support), the organization
can state this in its reported information.
If the organization does not facilitate access to non-occupational medical and healthcare
services for workers who are not employees because the employer of those workers facilitates
their access to these services, the organization can state this in its reported information.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-6-b
Ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages is one of the UN Sustainable
Development Goals (Goal 3). This goal includes targets such as reducing premature mortality
from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment, and promoting mental
health and wellbeing; strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including
narcotic drug abuse and harmful consumption of alcohol; ensuring universal access to sexual
and reproductive healthcare services; and ending epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and
neglected tropical diseases, and combating hepatitis, water-borne diseases, and other
communicable diseases.
Disclosure 403-6-b covers voluntary services and programs aimed at addressing major non-
work-related health risks among workers, including both physical and mental health-related
risks. Examples of these risks include smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, physical inactivity,
unhealthy diets, HIV, and psychosocial factors.
Voluntary health promotion programs and services might include smoking cessation programs,
dietary advice, offering of healthy food in the canteen, stress-reducing programs, provision of a
gym, or fitness programs. A program or service is voluntary when it does not set mandatory
17 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
personal targets, and if incentives are provided, these are not associated with the organization’s
decisions regarding employment or engagement of workers.
Voluntary health promotion services and programs complement but cannot be a substitute for
occupational health and safety services, programs and systems that prevent harm and protect
workers from work-related injuries and ill health. Voluntary health promotion and occupational
health and safety may be managed jointly by the organization, as part of an overall approach to
ensuring the health and safety of workers.
When describing how it facilitates workers’ access to voluntary health promotion services and
programs, the organization can explain whether it allows workers to make use of these during
paid working hours. The organization can also report if these services and programs are
available for family members of workers.
When describing its voluntary health promotion services and programs, the organization can
also report:
• how the topics covered in these services and programs are selected, including how workers
are engaged in the selection of topics;
• the extent to which these services and programs include proven effective interventions (see
reference [19] in the Bibliography);
• the metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of these services and programs;
• the approaches used to raise awareness about these services and programs and
encourage participation.
Guidance for clauses 1.5.1 and 1.5.2
Non-occupational health services and programs are expected to respect workers’ right to
privacy. Organizations are expected not to use workers' participation in such services and
programs, or the health data derived therefrom, as criteria for their decisions regarding the
employment or engagement of workers, including termination, demotion, promotion or offering
of prospects, compensation, or any other favorable or unfavorable treatment. See reference [6] in
the Bibliography.

Disclosure 403-7 Prevention and mitigation of occupational health
and safety impacts directly linked by business relationships
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. A description of the organization’s approach to preventing or mitigating significant
negative occupational health and safety impacts that are directly linked to its
operations, products, or services by its business relationships, and the related hazards
and risks.
Background
GUIDANCE
In cases where an organization has no control over both the work and workplace, it still has a
responsibility to make efforts, including exercising any leverage it might have, to prevent and
mitigate negative occupational health and safety impacts that are directly linked to its operations,
products, or services by its business relationships. For more guidance, see the Scope of
‘workers’ in this Standard section.

Disclosure 403-8 Workers covered by an occupational health and
safety management system
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. If the organization has implemented an occupational health and safety management
system based on legal requirements and/or recognized standards/guidelines:
i. the number and percentage of all employees and workers who are not employees
but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, who are
covered by such a system;
ii. the number and percentage of all employees and workers who are not employees
but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, who are
covered by such a system that has been internally audited;
iii. the number and percentage of all employees and workers who are not employees
but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, who are
covered by such a system that has been audited or certified by an external party.
b. Whether and, if so, why any workers have been excluded from this disclosure, including
the types of worker excluded.
c. Any contextual information necessary to understand how the data have been compiled,
such as any standards, methodologies, and assumptions used.
Background
GUIDANCE
Occupational health and safety management systems can serve as an effective approach to
managing and continually eliminating hazards and minimizing risks. It is a systems-based
approach that seeks to integrate occupational health and safety management into overall
business processes. A system typically moves through a ‘plan-do-check-act’ cycle, promoting
leadership and practice through meaningful consultation and participation of workers from all
job levels in the organization.
A systems-based approach, which encompasses fully integrated processes, can be a
significant advancement over an approach that considers hazard identification, risk
assessment, and incident investigation as isolated activities. Focusing on system deficiencies
can enable an organization to identify deficiencies in its overall management of occupational
health and safety; address resources, policy, and operational controls; and ensure continual
improvement.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-8
This disclosure indicates what proportion of an organization’s employees, and workers who are
not employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, are covered
by an occupational health and safety management system based on legal requirements and/or
recognized standards/guidelines. The list of legal requirements and/or recognized
standards/guidelines used by the reporting organization in its occupational health and safety
management system are reported using Disclosures 403-1-a-i and 403-1-a-ii in the Topic
management disclosures section.
If not all workers are covered by the occupational health and safety management system, the
organization can report whether any of the workers not covered are at high risk of work-related
injury or ill health.
In addition to the information required by this disclosure, the organization can report the number
and percentage of sites covered by an occupational health and safety management system
based on legal requirements and/or recognized standards/guidelines.
The organization can also describe:
• the approach used for internal audits (e.g., whether they are carried out following an
internally-developed audit standard or a recognized audit standard, what is the qualification
20 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
of the auditors);
• whether any processes or functions have been excluded from the scope of the audit or
certification, and how occupational health and safety performance is being monitored in
those areas;
• the audit or certification standard used.
Audits by external parties may include both second-party and third-party audits. Second-party
audits are usually performed by customers or others on behalf of customers, or by any other
external parties that have a formal interest in the organization. Third-party audits are performed
by independent organizations such as registrars (i.e., certification bodies) or regulators.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-8-b
Types of worker can be based on criteria such as full-time, part-time, non-guaranteed hours,
permanent or temporary basis, type or degree of control (e.g., control of work or workplace, sole
or shared control), and location, among others.

Guidance for Disclosure 403-9
GUIDANCE
This disclosure covers work-related injuries. Data on work-related injuries are a measure of the
extent of harm suffered by workers; they are not a measure of safety.
An increase in the number or rate of reported incidents does not necessarily mean that there
have been a greater number of incidents than before; it can indicate an improvement in the
recording and reporting of incidents.
If an increase in the number or rate of reported incidents is the result of the organization’s
actions to improve the reporting and recording of fatalities, injuries, and ill health, or its actions
to expand the scope of its management system to cover more workers or workplaces, the
reporting organization can explain this and report on these actions and their results.
Types of work-related injury can include death, amputation of a limb, laceration, fracture, hernia,
burns, loss of consciousness, and paralysis, among others.
In the context of this Standard, work-related musculoskeletal disorders are covered under ill
health (and not injuries) and are to be reported using Disclosure 403-10. If the organization
operates in a jurisdiction where worker compensation systems classify musculoskeletal
disorders as injuries, the organization can explain this and report these disorders using
Disclosure 403-9. See references [5] and [16] in the Bibliography for a list of musculoskeletal
disorders.
Injuries involving members of the public as a result of a work-related incident are not included in
this disclosure, but the organization can report this information separately. For example, the
organization can report incidents where a vehicle driven by a worker causes the deaths of other
road users or incidents where visitors are injured during their visit to the organization’s
workplace.
Guidance for reporting on high-consequence work-related injuries
As per the definition of recordable work-related injury, the organization is required to report all
work-related injuries as part of the ‘number and rate of recordable work-related injuries’. In
addition, the organization is required to separately report high-consequence work- related
injuries, with a breakdown by:
• fatalities, to be reported using Disclosures 403-9-a-i and 403-9-b-i.
• other injuries from which the worker cannot recover (e.g., amputation of a limb), or does not
or is not expected to recover fully to pre-injury health status within 6 months (e.g., fracture
23 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
with complications), to be reported using Disclosures 403-9-a-ii and 403-9-b-ii.
The definition of ‘high-consequence work-related injury’ uses ‘recovery time’, instead of ‘lost
time’, as the criterion for determining the severity of an injury. Lost time is an indicator of the loss
of productivity for an organization as a result of a work-related injury; it does not necessarily
indicate the extent of harm suffered by a worker.
‘Recovery time’, in contrast, refers to the time needed for a worker to recover fully to pre-injury
health status; it does not refer to the time needed for a worker to return to work. In some cases,
a worker might return to work before full recovery.
In addition to reporting information on high-consequence work-related injuries based on
recovery time as required by this disclosure, the organization can also report the number and
rate of work-related injuries that resulted in lost-workday cases, the average number of lost days
per lost-workday case, the number of lost workdays, and the absentee rate.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-9-c
This disclosure covers work-related hazards that pose a risk of high-consequence injury if not
controlled, even when there are control measures in place. The hazards might have been
identified proactively through risk assessment, or reactively as a result of either a high-potential
incident or a high-consequence injury.
Examples of work-related hazards causing or contributing to high-consequence injuries include
excessive workload demands, tripping hazards, or exposure to flammable materials.
If the identified work-related hazards vary significantly across different locations, the organization
may group or disaggregate these by relevant categories, such as by geographical area or
business line. Similarly, if there are a high number of hazards, the organization may group or
categorize them to facilitate reporting.
When reporting how it has determined which work-related hazards pose a risk of high-
consequence injury using Disclosure 403-9-c-i, the organization can describe the criteria or
threshold used to determine which hazards pose such a risk and which do not. The processes
to identify hazards and assess risks, and to apply the hierarchy of controls, are reported using
Disclosure 403-2-a.
Disclosure 403-9-c-ii does not require reporting which work-related hazards have caused or
contributed to which high-consequence injuries during the reporting period; it requires the
aggregate analysis of all work-related hazards that resulted in high-consequence injuries.
If a work-related incident resulting in a high-consequence injury is still under investigation at the
end of the reporting period, the organization can state this in its reported information. The
organization can report on actions taken during the reporting period to eliminate hazards and
minimize risks that were identified, or to address work-related incidents that took place, in prior
reporting periods.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-9-d
This disclosure covers any actions taken or underway to eliminate other work-related hazards
and minimize risks (i.e., not covered in Disclosure 403-9-c) using the hierarchy of controls. This
disclosure can include actions taken in response to non-high-consequence work-related
injuries, and work-related incidents with low probability of causing high-consequence injuries.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-9-f
Types of worker can be based on criteria such as full-time, part-time, non-guaranteed hours,
permanent or temporary basis, type or degree of control (e.g., control of work or workplace, sole
or shared control), and location, among others.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-9-g
If the organization follows the ILO code of practice on Recording and notification of occupational
accidents and diseases, it can state this in response to Disclosure 403-9-g.
If the organization does not follow the ILO code of practice, it can indicate which system of rules
it applies in recording and reporting work-related injuries and its relationship to the ILO code of
practice.
24 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
If the organization cannot directly calculate the number of hours worked, it may estimate this on
the basis of normal or standard hours of work, taking into account entitlements to periods of
paid leave of absence from work (e.g., paid vacations, paid sick leave, public holidays) and
explain this in its reported information.
When the organization cannot directly calculate or estimate the number of hours worked (e.g.,
because the workers performed non-routine work during an emergency situation, or because
the performed work was not paid for by the hour), it is required to provide a reason for this
omission as set out in GRI 1: Foundation 2021. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1 for requirements
on reasons for omission.
Guidance for clause 2.1.3
Clause 2.1.3 requires the organization to include injuries as a result of commuting incidents in
cases where the transport has been organized by the organization (e.g., company or contracted
bus or vehicle). The organization can report other commuting incidents separately; for example if
this information is to be reported under local law.
Guidance for clause 2.1.4
Clause 2.1.4 requires the organization to calculate the rates based on either 200,000 or
1,000,000 hours worked.
Standardized rates allow for meaningful comparisons of statistics, for example between
different periods or organizations, or help account for differences in the number of workers in the
reference group and the number of hours worked by them.
A rate based on 200,000 hours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 100
full-time workers over a one-year timeframe, based on the assumption that one full-time worker
works 2,000 hours per year. For example, a rate of 1.0 means that, on average, there is one
work-related injury for every group of 100 full-time workers over a one-year timeframe. A rate
based on 1,000,000 hours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full-
time workers over a one-year timeframe.
A rate based on 200,000 hours worked might be more suitable for small organizations.
In addition to standardized rates, this disclosure requires the organization to report absolute
data (i.e., numbers), to allow information users to calculate the rates themselves using other
methodologies if needed.
Guidance for clauses 2.2.1 and 2.2.2
Target 8.8 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals aims to ‘protect labour rights and promote
safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular
women migrants, and those in precarious employment’. Some groups might be at increased
risk of work-related injury due to demographic factors such as sex, gender, migrant status, or
age; it can thus be beneficial to break down data on work-related injuries by these demographic
criteria. See reference [14] in the Bibliography.
ILO Convention 143 ‘Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention’ defines ‘migrant
worker’ as ‘a person who migrates or who has migrated from one country to another with a view
to being employed otherwise than on his own account and includes any person regularly
admitted as a migrant worker’. See ILO Convention 143 for more guidance.
If the data on work-related injuries are driven primarily by certain types of injury (e.g., amputation,
paralysis) or incident (e.g., explosion, road accident), the organization can provide a breakdown
of this information.

Disclosure 403-10 Work-related ill health
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. For all employees:
i. The number of fatalities as a result of work-related ill health;
ii. The number of cases of recordable work-related ill health;

chemicals;
2.4.3 The number of employees and workers who are not employees but whose work
and/or workplace is controlled by the organization, exposed to each hazard
identified in Disclosure 403-10-c.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-10
GUIDANCE
Work-related ill health can include acute, recurring, and chronic health problems caused or
aggravated by work conditions or practices. They include musculoskeletal disorders, skin and
respiratory diseases, malignant cancers, diseases caused by physical agents (e.g., noise-
induced hearing loss, vibration-caused diseases), and mental illnesses (e.g., anxiety, post-
traumatic stress disorder). This disclosure covers, but is not limited to, the diseases included in
the ILO List of Occupational Diseases. In the context of this Standard, work-related
musculoskeletal disorders are covered under ill health (and not injuries) and are to be reported
using this disclosure. See references [5] and [16] in the Bibliography.
This disclosure covers all cases of work-related ill health notified to the reporting organization or
identified by the organization through medical surveillance, during the reporting period. The
organization might be notified of cases of work-related ill health through reports by affected
workers, compensation agencies, or healthcare professionals. The disclosure may include
cases of work-related ill health that were detected during the reporting period among former
workers. If the organization determines, for example through investigation, that the notified case
26 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
of work-related ill health is not due to exposure whilst working for the organization, it can explain
this in its reported information.
This disclosure covers both short-latency and long-latency work-related ill health. Latency refers
to the time period between exposure and the onset of ill health.
Many cases of long-latency work-related ill health go undetected; if detected, they might not
necessarily be due to exposures with one employer. For example, a worker might be exposed to
asbestos while working for different employers over time, or might suffer from a long-latency
disease that turns fatal many years after the worker has left the organization. For this reason,
data on work-related ill health are to be complemented with information on work-related
hazards.
In some situations, an organization might not be able to collect or publicly disclose data on
work-related ill health. The following are examples of these situations:
• National or regional regulations, contractual obligations, health insurance provisions, and
other legal requirements related to the privacy of workers’ health-related information, might
prevent organizations from collecting, maintaining, and publicly reporting these data.
• The nature of information on workers’ exposure to psychosocial factors, largely based on
self-disclosure and in many instances protected under healthcare privacy regulations, might
limit organizations in disclosing this information.
In these situations, the organization is required to provide a reason for omission of these data
as set out in GRI 1: Foundation 2021. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1 for requirements on reasons
for omission.
Cases of ill health involving members of the public as a result of a work-related incident are not
included in this disclosure, but the organization can report this information separately. An
example of such an incident is when a chemical substance spill causes ill health among
members of a nearby community.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-10-c
This disclosure includes exposures to the 'International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
Group 1’ (carcinogenic to humans), ‘IARC Group 2A’ (probably carcinogenic to humans), and
‘IARC Group 2B’ (possibly carcinogenic to humans) agents. See references [17] and [18] in the
Bibliography.
See Guidance for Disclosure for 403-9-c for more information on reporting on hazards.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-10-d
Types of worker can be based on criteria such as full-time, part-time, non-guaranteed hours,
permanent or temporary basis, type or degree of control (e.g., control of work or workplace, sole
or shared control), and location, among others.
Guidance for Disclosure 403-10-e
If the organization follows the ILO code of practice on Recording and notification of occupational
accidents and diseases, it can state this in response to Disclosure 403-10-e.
If the organization does not follow the ILO code of practice, it can indicate which system of rules
it applies in recording and reporting work-related ill health and its relationship to the ILO code of
practice.
Guidance for clause 2.4.1
If the data on work-related ill health are driven primarily by certain types of ill health or disease
(e.g., respiratory diseases, skin diseases) or incident (e.g., exposure to bacteria or viruses), the
organization can provide a breakdown of this information.

hierarchy of controls
systematic approach to enhance occupational health and safety, eliminate hazards, and
minimize risks
Note 1: The hierarchy of controls seeks to protect workers by ranking the ways in which
hazards can be controlled. Each control in the hierarchy is considered less effective
than the one before it. The priority is to eliminate the hazard, which is the most
effective way to control it.
Note 2: The International Labour Organization (ILO) Guidelines on Occupational Safety and
Health Management Systems, 2001 and ISO 45001:2018 list the following
preventive and protective measures in the following order of priority:
• eliminate the hazard/risk;
• substitute the hazard/risk with less hazardous processes, operations,
materials, or equipment;
• control the hazard/risk at source, through the use of engineering controls or
organizational measures;
• minimize the hazard/risk by the design of safe work systems, which include
administrative control measures;
• where residual hazards/risks cannot be controlled by collective measures,
provide for appropriate personal protective equipment, including clothing, at no
cost, and implement measures to ensure its use and maintenance.

stumbling and falling; body movement without stress; body movement under/with
stress; shock, fright; workplace violence or harassment (e.g., sexual harassment).
Note 2: An incident that results in injury or ill health is often referred to as an ‘accident’. An
incident that has the potential to result in injury or ill health but where none occurs is
often referred to as a ‘close call', ‘near-miss’, or ‘near-hit’.
work-related injury or ill health
negative impacts on health arising from exposure to hazards at work
Source: International Labour Organization (ILO), Guidelines on Occupational Safety and
Health Management Systems, ILO-OSH 2001, 2001; modified
Note 1: ‘Ill health’ indicates damage to health and includes diseases, illnesses, and
disorders. The terms ‘disease’, ‘illness’, and ‘disorder’ are often used
interchangeably and refer to conditions with specific symptoms and diagnoses.
32 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
Note 2: Work-related injuries and ill health are those that arise from exposure to hazards at
work. Other types of incident can occur that are not connected with the work itself.
For example, the following incidents are not considered to be work related:
• a worker suffers a heart attack while at work that is unconnected with work;
• a worker driving to or from work is injured in a car accident (where driving is not
part of the work, and where the transport has not been organized by the
employer);
• a worker with epilepsy has a seizure at work that is unconnected with work.
Note 3: Traveling for work: Injuries and ill health that occur while a worker is traveling are
work related if, at the time of the injury or ill health, the worker was engaged in work
activities ‘in the interest of the employer’. Examples of such activities include
traveling to and from customer contacts; conducting job tasks; and entertaining or
being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (at the direction of the
employer).
Working at home: Injuries and ill health that occur when working at home are work
related if the injury or ill health occurs while the worker is performing work at home,
and the injury or ill health is directly related to the performance of work rather than
the general home environment or setting.
Mental illness: A mental illness is considered to be work related if it has been
notified voluntarily by the worker and is supported by an opinion from a licensed
healthcare professional with appropriate training and experience stating that the
illness is work related.

Note 4: The terms ‘occupational’ and ‘work-related’ are often used interchangeably.
worker
person that performs work for the organization
Examples: employees, agency workers, apprentices, contractors, home workers, interns, self-
employed persons, sub-contractors, volunteers, and persons working for
organizations other than the reporting organization, such as for suppliers
Note: In the GRI Standards, in some cases, it is specified whether a particular subset of
workers is required to be used.
worker consultation
seeking of workers’ views before making a decision
Note 1: Worker consultation might be carried out through workers’ representatives.
Note 2: Consultation is a formal process, whereby management takes the views of workers
into account when making a decision. Therefore, consultation needs to take place
before the decision is made. It is essential to provide timely information to workers
or their representatives in order for them to provide meaningful and effective input
before decisions are made. Genuine consultation involves dialogue.
Note 3: Worker participation and worker consultation are two distinct terms with specific
meanings. See definition of ‘worker participation’.
worker participation
workers’ involvement in decision-making
Note 1: Worker participation might be carried out through workers’ representatives.
Note 2: Worker participation and worker consultation are two distinct terms with specific
meanings. See definition of ‘worker consultation’.
33 GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
worker representative
person who is recognized as such under national law or practice, whether they are:
• a trade union representative, namely, a representative designated or elected by trade unions
or by members of such unions; or
• an elected representative, namely, a representative who is freely elected by the workers of
the undertaking in accordance with provisions of national laws, regulations, or collective
agreements, whose functions do not include activities which are recognized as the exclusive
prerogative of trade unions in the country concerned.
