Introduction
GRI 203: Indirect Economic Impacts 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their
indirect economic impacts, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its indirect
economic impacts.
• Section 2 contains two disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s indirect economic impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses an organization’s indirect economic impacts, including impacts of an organization’s
infrastructure investments and services supported.
An economic impact can be defined as a change in the productive potential of the economy that has an influence on a
community’s or stakeholder’s well-being and longer-term prospects for development. Indirect economic impacts are
the additional consequences of the direct impact of financial transactions and the flow of money between an
organization and its stakeholders.
Indirect economic impacts can be monetary or non-monetary, and are particularly important to assess in relation to
local communities and regional economies.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its indirect economic impacts.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined indirect economic impacts to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s indirect economic impacts
(Disclosure 203-1 through Disclosure 203-2).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).

Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
7 GRI 203: Indirect Economic Impacts 2016
1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined indirect economic impacts to be a material topic is required to report how it
manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages indirect economic impacts
REQUIREMENTS
using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
1.2 The reporting organization should:
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.2.1 describe work undertaken to understand indirect economic impacts at the
national, regional, or local level;
1.2.2 explain whether it conducted a community needs assessment to determine the
need for infrastructure and other services, and describe the results of the
assessment.
8 GRI 203: Indirect Economic Impacts 2016
2. Topic disclosures
An organization is expected to compile information for economic disclosures using figures from its audited financial
statements or from its internally-audited management accounts, whenever possible. Data can be compiled using, for
example:
• the relevant International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), published by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB), and the Interpretations developed by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (specific IFRS
are referenced for some of the disclosures);
• the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the International Federation of
Accountants (IFAC);
• national or regional standards recognized internationally for the purpose of financial reporting.
Disclosure 203-1 Infrastructure investments and services supported
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Extent of development of significant infrastructure investments and services
supported.
b. Current or expected impacts on communities and local economies, including positive
and negative impacts where relevant.
c. Whether these investments and services are commercial, in-kind, or pro bono
engagements.
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 203-1, the reporting organization
RECOMMENDATIONS
should disclose:
2.1.1 the size, cost and duration of each significant infrastructure investment or service
supported;
2.1.2 the extent to which different communities or local economies are impacted by the
organization’s infrastructure investments and services supported.
Background
GUIDANCE
This disclosure concerns the impact that an organization’s infrastructure investments and
services supported have on its stakeholders and the economy.
The impacts of infrastructure investment can extend beyond the scope of an organization’s own
operations and over a longer timescale. Such investments can include transport links, utilities,
community social facilities, health and welfare centers, and sports centers. Along with
investment in its own operations, this is one measure of the organization’s capital contribution
to the economy.
9 GRI 203: Indirect Economic Impacts 2016
Disclosure 203-2 Significant indirect economic impacts
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Examples of significant identified indirect economic impacts of the organization,
including positive and negative impacts.
b. Significance of the indirect economic impacts in the context of external benchmarks
and stakeholder priorities, such as national and international standards, protocols, and
policy agendas.
Guidance for Disclosure 203-2
GUIDANCE
This disclosure concerns the spectrum of indirect economic impacts that an organization can
have on its stakeholders and the economy.
Examples of significant indirect economic impacts, both positive and negative, can include:
• changes in the productivity of organizations, sectors, or the whole economy (such as through
greater adoption of information technology);
• economic development in areas of high poverty (such as changes in the total number of
dependents supported through the income of a single job);
• economic impacts of improving or deteriorating social or environmental conditions (such as
changing job market in an area converted from small farms to large plantations, or the
economic impacts of pollution);
• availability of products and services for those on low incomes (such as preferential pricing of
pharmaceuticals, which contributes to a healthier population that can participate more fully in
the economy; or pricing structures that exceed the economic capacity of those on low
incomes);
• enhanced skills and knowledge in a professional community or in a geographic location
(such as when shifts in an organization’s needs attract additional skilled workers to an area,
who, in turn, drive a local need for new learning institutions);
• number of jobs supported in the supply or distribution chain (such as the employment
impacts on suppliers as a result of an organization’s growth or contraction);
• stimulating, enabling, or limiting foreign direct investment (such as when an organization
changes the infrastructure or services it provides in a developing country, which then leads to
changes in foreign direct investment in the region);
• economic impacts from a change in operation or activity location (such as the impact of
outsourcing jobs to an overseas location);
• economic impacts from the use of products and services (such as economic growth
resulting from the use of a particular product or service).
