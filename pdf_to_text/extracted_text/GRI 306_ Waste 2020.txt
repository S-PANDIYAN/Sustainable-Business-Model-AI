Introduction
GRI 306: Waste 2020 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their waste-related impacts,
and how they manage these impacts. The disclosures enable an organization to provide information on how it
prevents waste generation and how it manages waste that cannot be prevented, in its own activities and upstream
and downstream in its value chain.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains two disclosures, which provide information about how the organization manages its waste-
related impacts.
• Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s waste-related impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing
this Standard.
• The Appendix includes examples of process flows and examples of templates for presenting information for
Disclosures 306-3, 306-4, and 306-5.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of waste.
Waste can be generated in the organization’s own activities, for example, during the production of its products and
delivery of services. It can also be generated by entities upstream and downstream in the organization’s value chain,
for example, when suppliers process materials that are later used or procured by the organization, or when
consumers use the services or discard the products that the organization sells to them.
Waste can have significant negative impacts on the environment and human health when inadequately managed.
These impacts often extend beyond locations where waste is generated and discarded. The resources and materials
contained in waste that is incinerated or landfilled are lost to future use, which accelerates their depletion.
The United Nations recognizes the role of responsible consumption and production in achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals1. The targets under Goal 12, in particular, call on organizations to implement environmentally
sound waste management and prevent and reduce waste through reuse and recycling.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
1 United Nations (UN) Resolution, Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 2015. (See in particular Goal 12: ‘Ensure
sustainable consumption and production patterns’.)
5 GRI 306: Waste 2020
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its waste-related impacts. This Standard can also be used by organizations
that manage waste generated by other organizations, such as public and private waste management organizations.
In addition to this Standard, disclosures that relate to this topic can be found in GRI 301: Materials 2016.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined waste to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s waste-related impacts (Disclosure
306-1 through Disclosure 306-5).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
6 GRI 306: Waste 2020
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
7 GRI 306: Waste 2020
1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined waste to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using
Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section). The organization is also required to
report any disclosures from this section (Disclosure 306-1 through Disclosure 306-2) that are relevant to its waste-
related impacts.
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages waste using Disclosure 3-3 in
REQUIREMENTS
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
8 GRI 306: Waste 2020
Disclosure 306-1 Waste generation and significant waste-related
impacts
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. For the organization’s significant actual and potential waste-related impacts, a
description of:
i. the inputs, activities, and outputs that lead or could lead to these impacts;
ii. whether these impacts relate to waste generated in the organization’s own
activities or to waste generated upstream or downstream in its value chain.
1.2 The reporting organization should report a process flow of inputs, activities, and outputs
RECOMMENDATIONS
that lead or could lead to significant waste-related impacts.
Background
GUIDANCE
The quantity, type, and quality of waste generated by an organization is a consequence of the
activities involved in the production of its products and services (e.g., extraction, processing,
procurement of materials, product or service design, production, distribution) and their
subsequent consumption. An assessment of how materials move into, through, and out of the
organization can help understand where in the organization’s value chain these materials
eventually become waste. This provides a holistic overview of waste generation and its causes,
which in turn can support the organization in identifying opportunities for waste prevention and
for adopting circularity measures. In this way, the organization can go beyond mitigating and
remediating negative impacts once waste has been generated and move towards managing
waste as a resource.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-1
When reporting on this disclosure, the organization can specify the types of inputs and outputs.
The types of inputs and outputs can include raw materials, process and manufacturing
materials, leaks and losses, waste, by-products, products, or packaging.
The organization can assess and report whether inputs, activities, and outputs lead or could
lead to significant waste-related impacts using the following criteria:
• Quantity of inputs used to produce the organization’s products or services, which will
become waste after they are used for production.
• Quantity of waste outputs generated in the organization’s own activities, or quantity of outputs
it provides to entities downstream that will eventually become waste when they reach their
end of life.
• Hazardous characteristics of inputs and outputs.
• Properties of input materials or design characteristics of outputs that limit or prevent their
recovery or limit the length of their life.
• Known potential negative threats associated with specific materials when they are
discarded. For example, the potential threat of marine pollution resulting from leakage of
discarded plastic packaging into waterbodies.
• Types of activities that lead to significant quantities of waste generation or to generation of
hazardous waste.
The organization is required to report on inputs that it receives from entities upstream in its value
chain, as well as outputs it provides to entities downstream in its value chain. For example, if an
organization procures components with hazardous characteristics from a supplier and uses
these in a product that will continue to carry these components and their hazardous
characteristics, the organization is required to report these components under inputs that lead
or could lead to significant waste-related impacts. Similarly, if an organization sells to
consumers products that generate large quantities of packaging waste, it is required to report
this packaging under outputs that lead or could lead to significant waste-related impacts.
If the organization has identified many inputs and outputs or many activities that lead or could
lead to significant waste-related impacts, it may group these by:
• product or service category that the inputs and outputs relate to;
• business units or facilities that procure the inputs, or whose activities produce the outputs;
9 GRI 306: Waste 2020
• categories of upstream and downstream activities that produce the outputs (for examples of
upstream and downstream categories, see the guidance for Disclosure 302-2 in GRI 302:
Energy 2016).
Guidance for clause 1.2
A process flow is a tool to visualize the information required to be reported under Disclosure
306-1. A graphic illustration of the process flow can help the organization and its stakeholders
understand how inputs and outputs move through the organization’s own activities as well as
through the activities of entities upstream and downstream in its value chain. It shows where
waste is generated in the value chain or where outputs become waste.
The organization can also use the process flow to illustrate information that is required under
other disclosures of this Standard, such as:
• actions taken to prevent waste generation (Disclosure 306-2);
• composition of waste generated (Disclosure 306-3);
• recovery operations used to divert waste from disposal (Disclosure 306-4);
• disposal operations (Disclosure 306-5).
The organization can include estimates of the weight of inputs and the weight of outputs in
metric tons or the ratio of inputs to outputs.
For examples of process flow illustrations, see the Appendix.
10 GRI 306: Waste 2020
Disclosure 306-2 Management of significant waste-related impacts
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Actions, including circularity measures, taken to prevent waste generation in the
organization’s own activities and upstream and downstream in its value chain, and to
manage significant impacts from waste generated.
b. If the waste generated by the organization in its own activities is managed by a third
party, a description of the processes used to determine whether the third party
manages the waste in line with contractual or legislative obligations.
c. The processes used to collect and monitor waste-related data.
Background
GUIDANCE
An organization can cause waste-related impacts through its own activities. For example, when
its operations generate waste outputs. It can also contribute to waste-related impacts through
activities carried out in its value chain upstream or downstream. For example, through criteria in
its procurement policies that lead to waste generation upstream, or through management
decisions that limit the life of its products and therefore contribute to waste generation
downstream.
Even when the organization has not contributed to waste-related impacts upstream or
downstream in its value chain, its operations, products, or services could be directly linked to
waste-related impacts by its business relationships with the entities in its value chain. For
example, when third parties hired by the organization carry out inadequate recovery or disposal
operations.
The way an organization is involved with negative impacts is important for determining the
organization’s response to an impact.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-2-a
Actions, including circularity measures, to prevent waste generation and to manage significant
impacts from waste generated can include:
• Input material choices and product design:
- Improving materials selection and product design through consideration for longevity and
durability, repairability, modularity and disassembly, and recyclability.
- Reducing the use of raw and finite materials by procuring secondary materials (e.g.,
used or recycled input materials) or renewable materials.
- Substituting inputs that have hazardous characteristics with inputs that are non-
hazardous.
• Collaboration in the value chain and business model innovation:
- Setting policies for procurement from suppliers that have sound waste prevention and
waste management criteria.
- Engaging in or setting up industrial symbiosis as a result of which the organization’s
waste or other outputs (e.g., by-products from production) become inputs for another
organization.
- Participating in a collective or individual extended producer responsibility scheme or
applying product stewardship, which extends the producer’s responsibility for a product
or service to its end of life.
- Transitioning to and applying new business models, such as product service systems
that use services instead of products to meet consumer demand.
- Engaging in or setting up product take-back schemes and reverse logistics processes to
divert products and materials from disposal.
• End-of-life interventions:
- Establishing and improving facilities for waste management, including facilities for the
collection and sorting of waste.
- Recovering products, components, and materials from waste through preparation for
reuse and recycling.
- Engaging with consumers to raise awareness about sustainable consumption practices,
such as reduced purchasing of products, product sharing, exchange, reuse, and
11 GRI 306: Waste 2020
recycling.
See references [9] and [11] in the Bibliography.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-2-b
This disclosure can provide insight into the level of control the organization assumes for waste
management outsourced to a third party. In the context of this Standard, a third party includes a
public or private waste management organization, or any other entity or group of individuals
formally or informally involved in handling the reporting organization’s waste. Waste
management by third parties can include the collection, transportation, recovery, and disposal of
waste, as well as the supervision of such operations and the aftercare of disposal sites. The
organization may specify agreements in a contract for the third party to follow when managing its
waste, or rely on existing legislative obligations, such as local environmental laws and
regulations, to ensure that the third party manages the waste adequately.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-2-c
The processes that the organization has in place for collecting and monitoring waste-related
data can reflect its commitment to managing waste-related impacts. Such processes can
include online data entry, maintaining a centralized database, real-time weighbridge
measurement, and annual external data validation.
The organization can specify whether the data collection and monitoring processes extend
beyond waste generated in its own activities to include waste generated upstream and
downstream in its value chain.
12 GRI 306: Waste 2020
2. Topic disclosures
Disclosure 306-3 Waste generated
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Total weight of waste generated in metric tons, and a breakdown of this total by
composition of the waste.
b. Contextual information necessary to understand the data and how the data has been
compiled.
Compilation requirements
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 306-3-a, the reporting
organization shall:
2.1.1 exclude effluent, unless required by national legislation to be reported under
total waste;
2.1.2 use 1000 kilograms as the measure for a metric ton.
Background
GUIDANCE
The total weight of waste generated, when contrasted with the weight of waste that the
organization directs to recovery and disposal, can show the extent to which the organization
manages its waste-related impacts.
The composition of the waste generated can help identify recovery or disposal operations
appropriate to the type of waste and to the specific materials present in the waste.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-3
This disclosure covers waste generated in the organization’s own activities. The organization
can separately report waste generated upstream and downstream in its value chain, if this
information is available.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-3-a
When reporting composition of the waste, the organization can describe:
• the type of waste, such as hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste;
• the waste streams, relevant to its sector or activities (e.g., tailings for an organization in the
mining sector, electronic waste for an organization in the consumer electronics sector, or
food waste for an organization in the agriculture or in the hospitality sector);
• the materials that are present in the waste (e.g., biomass, metals, non-metallic minerals,
plastics, textiles).
Templates for how to present information under this disclosure can be found in the Appendix
Tables.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-3-b
To help understand the data, the organization can explain the reasons for the difference
between the weight of waste generated and the weight of waste directed to recovery or disposal.
This difference can be a result of precipitation or evaporation, leaks or losses, or other
modifications to the waste. In the context of this Standard, leaks result from physical or technical
failures (e.g., a trail of waste from a waste collection truck), while losses result from inadequate
security measures or administrative failures (e.g., theft or lost records).
To help understand how the data has been compiled, the organization can specify whether the
data has been modeled or sourced from direct measurements, such as waste transfer notes
from contracted waste collectors, external assurance, or audits of waste-related data.
See references [1], [4], [10], and [11] in the Bibliography.
13 GRI 306: Waste 2020
Disclosure 306-4 Waste diverted from disposal
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Total weight of waste diverted from disposal in metric tons, and a breakdown of this
total by composition of the waste.
b. Total weight of hazardous waste diverted from disposal in metric tons, and a
breakdown of this total by the following recovery operations:
i. Preparation for reuse;
ii. Recycling;
iii. Other recovery operations.
c. Total weight of non-hazardous waste diverted from disposal in metric tons, and a
breakdown of this total by the following recovery operations:
i. Preparation for reuse;
ii. Recycling;
iii. Other recovery operations.
d. For each recovery operation listed in Disclosures 306-4-b and 306-4-c, a breakdown of
the total weight in metric tons of hazardous waste and of non-hazardous waste diverted
from disposal:
i. onsite;
ii. offsite.
e. Contextual information necessary to understand the data and how the data has been
compiled.
Compilation requirements
2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 306-4, the reporting
organization shall:
2.2.1 exclude effluent, unless required by national legislation to be reported under
total waste;
2.2.2 use 1000 kilograms as the measure for a metric ton.
2.3 The reporting organization should report the total weight of waste prevented, and the
RECOMMENDATIONS
baseline and methodology for this calculation.
Background
GUIDANCE
An organization’s choice of operations to manage waste shows how it addresses significant
waste-related impacts. The options to manage waste can be informed by the waste
management hierarchy, which orders operations to manage waste from the most preferable to
the least preferable. The waste management hierarchy prioritizes waste prevention, followed by
recovery operations that divert waste from being sent to disposal, such as preparation for reuse,
recycling, and other recovery operations.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-4
Templates for how to present information under this disclosure can be found in the Appendix
Tables.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-4-a
When reporting composition of the waste, the organization can describe:
• the type of waste, such as hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste;
• the waste streams, relevant to its sector or activities (e.g., tailings for an organization in the
mining sector, electronic waste for an organization in the consumer electronics sector, or
food waste for an organization in the agriculture or in the hospitality sector);
• the materials that are present in the waste (e.g., biomass, metals, non-metallic minerals,
plastics, textiles).
14 GRI 306: Waste 2020
Guidance for Disclosures 306-4-b and 306-4-c
When reporting on Disclosures 306-4-b-ii and 306-4-c-ii, the organization can specify the type of
recycling operations, such as downcycling, upcycling, composting, or anaerobic digestion.
Besides preparation for reuse and recycling, the organization can report the other types of
recovery operations it uses under Disclosures 306-4-b-iii and 306-4-c-iii, such as repurposing
or refurbishment.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-4-d
Reporting on the quantity and type of waste diverted from disposal onsite and offsite shows the
extent to which the organization knows how its waste is managed. In the context of this
Standard, ‘onsite’ means within the physical boundary or administrative control of the reporting
organization, and ‘offsite’ means outside the physical boundary or administrative control of the
reporting organization.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-4-e
To help understand the data, the organization can explain the reasons for the difference
between the weights of waste diverted from disposal onsite and offsite (e.g., lack of
infrastructure onsite to recover materials from waste). It can also describe sector practices,
sector standards, or external regulations that mandate a specific recovery operation.
To help understand how the data has been compiled, the organization can specify whether the
data has been modeled or sourced from direct measurements, such as waste transfer notes
from contracted waste collectors, external assurance, or audits of waste-related data.
Guidance for clause 2.3
Waste prevention is the most preferable option in the waste management hierarchy, as it
prevents the resulting impacts on the environment and human health. The organization can
calculate waste prevented as the reduction in waste generation resulting from the actions
reported under Disclosure 306-2-a. Reductions in waste generation resulting from reduced
production capacity are not considered waste prevention. The organization can report waste
prevented in its own activities as well as waste prevented in entities upstream and downstream
in its value chain.
See reference [1] in the Bibliography.
15 GRI 306: Waste 2020
Disclosure 306-5 Waste directed to disposal
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Total weight of waste directed to disposal in metric tons, and a breakdown of this total
by composition of the waste.
b. Total weight of hazardous waste directed to disposal in metric tons, and a breakdown
of this total by the following disposal operations:
i. Incineration (with energy recovery);
ii. Incineration (without energy recovery);
iii. Landfilling;
iv. Other disposal operations.
c. Total weight of non-hazardous waste directed to disposal in metric tons, and a
breakdown of this total by the following disposal operations:
i. Incineration (with energy recovery);
ii. Incineration (without energy recovery);
iii. Landfilling;
iv. Other disposal operations.
d. For each disposal operation listed in Disclosures 306-5-b and 306-5-c, a breakdown of
the total weight in metric tons of hazardous waste and of non-hazardous waste
directed to disposal:
i. onsite;
ii. offsite.
e. Contextual information necessary to understand the data and how the data has been
compiled.
Compilation requirements
2.4 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 306-5, the reporting
organization shall:
2.4.1 exclude effluent, unless required by national legislation to be reported under
total waste;
2.4.2 use 1000 kilograms as the measure for a metric ton.
Background
GUIDANCE
Disposal is the least preferable option in the waste management hierarchy because of its
negative impacts on the environment and human health. Leachate from landfills can
contaminate land and water, methane released from the decay of organic waste in landfills
contributes to climate change, and uncontrolled burning of waste contributes to air pollution.
Disposal prevents the materials present in the waste from being recirculated in the environment
and economy, making them unavailable for future use.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-5
Templates for how to present information under this disclosure can be found in the Appendix
Tables.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-5-a
When reporting composition of the waste, the organization can describe:
• the type of waste, such as hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste;
• the waste streams, relevant to its sector or activities (e.g., tailings for an organization in the
mining sector, electronic waste for an organization in the consumer electronics sector, or
food waste for an organization in the agriculture or in the hospitality sector);
• the materials that are present in the waste (e.g., biomass, metals, non-metallic minerals,
plastics, textiles).
Guidance for Disclosures 306-5-b and 306-5-c
Besides incineration and landfilling, the organization can specify the other types of disposal
16 GRI 306: Waste 2020
operations it uses under Disclosures 306-5-b-iv and 306-5-c-iv, such as dumping, open
burning, or deep well injection.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-5-d
Reporting the quantity and type of waste directed to disposal onsite and offsite shows the extent
to which the organization knows how its waste is managed. In the context of this Standard,
‘onsite’ means within the physical boundary or administrative control of the reporting
organization, and ‘offsite’ means outside the physical boundary or administrative control of the
reporting organization.
Guidance for Disclosure 306-5-e
To help understand the data, the organization can explain the reasons for the difference
between the weights of waste directed to disposal onsite and offsite (e.g., local regulations that
prohibit landfilling of specific types of waste). It can also describe sector practices, sector
standards, or external regulations that mandate a specific disposal operation.
To help understand how the data has been compiled, the organization can specify whether the
data has been modeled or sourced from direct measurements, such as waste transfer notes
from contracted waste collectors, external assurance, or audits of waste-related data.

• peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their
descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which
the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonization or the establishment of present
state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own
social, economic, cultural and political institutions.
