Introduction
GRI 207: Tax 2019 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their tax-related impacts, and
how they manage these impacts. The disclosures enable an organization to provide information on how it manages
tax, and information about its revenue, tax, and business activities on a country-by-country basis.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains three disclosures, which provide information about how the organization manages its tax-
related impacts.
• Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s tax-related impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing
this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of tax.
Taxes are important sources of government revenue and are central to the fiscal policy and macroeconomic stability
of countries.
They are acknowledged by the United Nations to play a vital role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.1
They are also a key mechanism by which organizations contribute to the economies of the countries in which they
operate.
Taxes paid by an organization reflect that profitability depends on many factors external to the organization, including
access to workers, markets, public infrastructure and services, natural resources, and a public administration.
Organizations have an obligation to comply with tax legislation, and a responsibility to their stakeholders to meet
expectations of good tax practices. If organizations seek to minimize their tax obligation in a jurisdiction, they might
deprive the government of revenue. This could lead to reduced investment in public infrastructure and services,
increase in government debt, or shifting of the tax obligation onto other tax payers.
Perceptions of tax avoidance by an organization could also undermine tax compliance more broadly, by driving other
organizations to engage in aggressive tax planning based on the view that they might otherwise be at a competitive
disadvantage. This can lead to increasing costs associated with tax regulation and enforcement.
Public reporting on tax increases transparency and promotes trust and credibility in the tax practices of organizations
and in the tax systems. It enables stakeholders to make informed judgments about an organization’s tax positions.
Tax transparency also informs public debate and supports the development of socially desirable tax policy.
Country-by-country reporting
Country-by-country reporting involves the reporting of financial, economic, and tax-related information for each
jurisdiction in which an organization operates. This indicates the organization’s scale of activity and the contribution it
makes through tax in these jurisdictions.
In combination with the topic management disclosures, country-by-country reporting gives insight into the
organization’s tax practices in different jurisdictions. It can also signal to stakeholders any potential reputational and
financial risks in the organization’s tax practices.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
1 United Nations (UN) Resolution, Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 2015. (See in particular Target 17.1: ‘Strengthen
domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other
revenue collection,’ under Goal 17: ‘Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.’)
5 GRI 207: Tax 2019
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its tax-related impacts.
6 GRI 207: Tax 2019
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined tax to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s tax-related impacts (Disclosure
207-1 through Disclosure 207-4).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
7 GRI 207: Tax 2019
1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined tax to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic using
Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section). The organization is also required to
report any disclosures from this section (Disclosure 207-1 through Disclosure 207-3) that are relevant to its tax-
related impacts.
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages tax using
REQUIREMENTS
Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
8 GRI 207: Tax 2019
Disclosure 207-1 Approach to tax
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. A description of the approach to tax, including:
i. whether the organization has a tax strategy and, if so, a link to this strategy if
publicly available;
ii. the governance body or executive-level position within the organization that
formally reviews and approves the tax strategy, and the frequency of this review;
iii. the approach to regulatory compliance;
iv. how the approach to tax is linked to the business and sustainable development
strategies of the organization.
Background
GUIDANCE
An organization’s approach to tax defines how the organization balances tax compliance with
business activities and ethical, societal, and sustainable development-related expectations. It
can include the organization’s tax principles, its attitude to tax planning, the degree of risk the
organization is willing to accept, and the organization’s approach to engaging with tax
authorities.
An organization’s approach to tax is often described in a tax strategy, but it could also be
described in equivalent documents, such as policies, standards, principles, or codes of
conduct.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-1-a
The reporting organization can illustrate its approach to tax by providing examples drawn from its
tax practices. For example, the organization can provide an overview of its use of tax havens, the
types of tax incentive it uses, or its approach to transfer pricing. These examples help
demonstrate the organization’s risk appetite and the tax practices deemed acceptable and
unacceptable by the organization and its highest governance body.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-1-a-i
If the organization has a tax strategy but the strategy is not publicly available, the organization
can provide an abstract or summary of the strategy.
If the organization has a tax strategy that applies to a smaller number of entities or tax
jurisdictions than reported in Disclosure 207-4, the organization may report this strategy and list
the entities or tax jurisdictions to which the strategy applies.
In addition to the overall strategy, if the organization has tax strategies that apply to individual
entities or tax jurisdictions, the organization can explain any relevant differences between these
strategies.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-1-a-iii
When describing its approach to regulatory compliance, the organization can describe any
statements in its tax strategy or equivalent documents regarding its intention with respect to the
tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. For example, the organization can describe
whether it seeks to comply with the letter and the spirit of the law. That is, whether the
organization takes reasonable steps to determine and follow the intention of the legislature.2
Guidance for Disclosure 207-1-a-iv
When describing how its approach to tax is linked to its business strategy, the organization can
explain how its tax planning is aligned with its commercial activities. The description can include
any relevant statements from its tax strategy or equivalent documents.
When describing how its approach to tax is linked to its sustainable development strategy, the
organization can explain the following:
• Whether it considered the economic and social impacts of its approach to tax when
developing its tax strategy.
• Any organizational commitments to sustainable development in the jurisdictions in which it
operates and whether its approach to tax is aligned with these commitments.

9 GRI 207: Tax 2019
Disclosure 207-2 Tax governance, control, and risk management
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. A description of the tax governance and control framework, including:
i. the governance body or executive-level position within the organization
accountable for compliance with the tax strategy;
ii. how the approach to tax is embedded within the organization;
iii. the approach to tax risks, including how risks are identified, managed, and
monitored;
iv. how compliance with the tax governance and control framework is evaluated.
b. A description of the mechanisms to raise concerns about the organization’s business
conduct and the organization’s integrity in relation to tax.
c. A description of the assurance process for disclosures on tax including, if applicable, a
link or reference to the external assurance report(s) or assurance statement(s).
Background
GUIDANCE
Having robust governance, control, and risk management systems in place for tax can be an
indication that the reported approach to tax and tax strategy are well embedded in an
organization and that the organization is effectively monitoring its compliance obligations.
Reporting this information reassures stakeholders that the organization’s practices reflect the
statements it has made about its approach to tax in its tax strategy or equivalent documents.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-a
When describing the tax governance and control framework, the reporting organization can
provide examples of effective implementation of its tax governance, control, and risk
management systems.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-a-i
If the highest governance body in an organization is accountable for compliance with the tax
strategy, the organization can specify the degree to which the highest governance body has
oversight of compliance. The organization can also specify any accountability for compliance
delegated to executive-level positions within the organization.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-a-ii
When reporting how the approach to tax is embedded within the organization, the organization
can describe processes, projects, programs, and initiatives that support adherence to the
approach to tax and tax strategy.
Examples of such initiatives can include:
• training and guidance provided to relevant employees on the link between tax strategy,
business strategy, and sustainable development;
• remuneration or incentive schemes for the person(s) responsible for implementing the tax
strategy;
• succession-planning for positions within the organization that are responsible for tax;
• participation in tax transparency initiatives or representative associations that seek to
develop best practice around disclosures on tax or educate stakeholders on tax-related
issues.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-a-iii
Tax risks are risks associated with the organization’s tax practices that might lead to a negative
effect on the goals of the organization, or to financial or reputational damage. These include
compliance risks or risks such as those related to uncertain tax positions, changes in
legislation, or a perception of aggressive tax practices.
When reporting on the approach to tax risks, the organization can describe its risk appetite and
tolerance and provide examples of tax practices it has avoided because they are misaligned
with its approach to tax and tax strategy. Risk appetite and tolerance indicate the degree of risk
the organization is willing to accept in determining its tax positions.
10 GRI 207: Tax 2019
When reporting how tax risks are identified, managed, and monitored, the organization can:
• describe the role of the highest governance body in the tax risk management process;
• describe how the tax risk management process is communicated and embedded across
the organization;
• refer to any internal control frameworks or generally accepted risk management principles
that are applied to tax.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-a-iv
When reporting how compliance with the tax governance and control framework is evaluated, the
organization can describe the process through which the tax governance and control framework
is monitored, tested, and maintained. An example of this is giving an internal auditor
accountability for undertaking annual reviews of the tax department’s compliance with the tax
governance and control framework.
The organization can also specify the degree to which the highest governance body has
oversight of the design, implementation, and effectiveness of the tax governance and control
framework.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-b
One example of a mechanism for individuals to raise concerns about the organization’s
business conduct, or about activities that compromise the organization’s integrity in relation to
tax, is whistleblowing.
Disclosure 207-2-b is related to Disclosure 2-26 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021. If the
information reported by the organization in Disclosure 2-26 covers mechanisms used to raise
concerns about the organization’s business conduct in relation to tax, the organization can
provide a reference to this information.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-2-c
Disclosure 207-2-c is related to Disclosure 2-5 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021. If the
assurance process for disclosures on tax has been completed as part of another assurance
process, the organization can provide a reference to this information reported in Disclosure 2-5
or elsewhere.
11 GRI 207: Tax 2019
Disclosure 207-3 Stakeholder engagement and management of
concerns related to tax
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. A description of the approach to stakeholder engagement and management of
stakeholder concerns related to tax, including:
i. the approach to engagement with tax authorities;
ii. the approach to public policy advocacy on tax;
iii. the processes for collecting and considering the views and concerns of
stakeholders, including external stakeholders.
Background
GUIDANCE
Organizations’ tax practices are of interest to various stakeholders. The approach an
organization takes to engaging with stakeholders has the potential to influence its reputation
and position of trust. This includes how the organization engages with tax authorities in the
development of tax systems, legislation, and administration.
Stakeholder engagement can enable the organization to understand evolving expectations
related to tax. It can give the organization insight into potential future regulatory changes and
enable the organization to better manage its risks and impacts.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-3-a-i
The approach to engagement with tax authorities can include participating in cooperative
compliance agreements, seeking active real-time audit, seeking clearance for all significant
transactions, engaging on tax risks, and seeking advance pricing agreements.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-3-a-ii
When reporting the approach to public policy advocacy on tax, the reporting organization can
describe:
• its lobbying activities related to tax;
• its stance on significant issues related to tax that it addresses in its public policy advocacy,
and any differences between its advocacy positions and its stated policies, goals, or other
public positions;
• whether it is a member of, or contributes to, any representative associations or committees
that participate in public policy advocacy on tax, including:
- the nature of this contribution;
- any differences between the organization’s stated policies, goals, or other public
positions on significant issues related to tax, and the positions of the representative
associations or committees.
Disclosure 207-3-a-ii is related to the requirements in GRI 415: Public Policy 2016. If the
organization has determined public policy to be a material topic and has reported information in
GRI 415 that covers the organization’s public policy advocacy on tax, the organization can provide
a reference to this information.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-3-a-iii
When reporting the processes for collecting and considering the views and concerns of
stakeholders, the organization can describe how the processes enable stakeholders to
participate in this engagement. The organization can also provide examples of how stakeholder
feedback has influenced the approach to tax, the tax strategy, or the tax practices of the
organization.
12 GRI 207: Tax 2019
2. Topic disclosures
Disclosure 207-4 Country-by-country reporting
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. All tax jurisdictions where the entities included in the organization’s audited
consolidated financial statements, or in the financial information filed on public record,
are resident for tax purposes.
b. For each tax jurisdiction reported in Disclosure 207-4-a:
i. Names of the resident entities;
ii. Primary activities of the organization;
iii. Number of employees, and the basis of calculation of this number;
iv. Revenues from third-party sales;
v. Revenues from intra-group transactions with other tax jurisdictions;
vi. Profit/loss before tax;
vii. Tangible assets other than cash and cash equivalents;
viii. Corporate income tax paid on a cash basis;
ix. Corporate income tax accrued on profit/loss;
x. Reasons for the difference between corporate income tax accrued on profit/loss
and the tax due if the statutory tax rate is applied to profit/loss before tax.
c. The time period covered by the information reported in Disclosure 207-4.
Compilation requirements
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 207-4, the reporting
organization shall report information for the time period covered by the most recent
audited consolidated financial statements or financial information filed on public
record. If information is not available for this time period, the organization may report
information for the time period covered by the audited consolidated financial
statements, or the financial information filed on public record, immediately preceding
the most recent ones.
2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 207-4-b, the reporting
organization shall:
2.2.1 reconcile the data reported for Disclosures 207-4-b-iv, vi, vii, and viii with the
data stated in its audited consolidated financial statements, or the financial
information filed on public record, for the time period reported in Disclosure
207-4-c. Where the data reported does not reconcile with the audited
consolidated financial statements, or the financial information filed on public
record, the organization shall provide an explanation for this difference;
2.2.2 for Disclosure 207-4-b-ix, include corporate income tax accrued in the time
period reported in Disclosure 207-4-c and exclude deferred corporate income
tax and provisions for uncertain tax positions;
2.2.3 in cases where an entity is deemed not to be resident in any tax jurisdiction,
provide the information for this stateless entity separately.
2.3 The reporting organization should report the following additional information for each tax
RECOMMENDATIONS
jurisdiction reported in Disclosure 207-4-a:
2.3.1 Total employee remuneration;
2.3.2 Taxes withheld and paid on behalf of employees;
2.3.3 Taxes collected from customers on behalf of a tax authority;
2.3.4 Industry-related and other taxes or payments to governments;
2.3.5 Significant uncertain tax positions;
2.3.6 Balance of intra-company debt held by entities in the tax jurisdiction, and the
basis of calculation of the interest rate paid on the debt.
13 GRI 207: Tax 2019
Background
GUIDANCE
Country-by-country reporting is the reporting of financial, economic, and tax-related information
for each jurisdiction in which the organization operates.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-a
In the context of this Standard, tax jurisdictions are identified according to where the entities
included in the organization’s audited consolidated financial statements, or in the financial
information filed on public record, are resident for tax purposes. These entities include
permanent establishments and dormant entities.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b
Unless otherwise stated, country-by-country information is to be reported at the level of tax
jurisdictions and not at the level of individual entities.
Number of employees, revenues, profit/loss before tax, and tangible assets other than cash and
cash equivalents are indicators of the organization’s scale of activity within a tax jurisdiction.
When considered in conjunction with the other required and recommended information, they
can inform assessments about the level of taxes being paid in a jurisdiction.
In addition to this information, the organization can report any other information relevant for
understanding the scale of its activity within a jurisdiction.
If the reporting organization cannot report all required information for all the tax jurisdictions
reported in Disclosure 207-4-a, it may use reasons for omission as set out in GRI 1: Foundation
2021. The organization is required to specify the requirement it cannot comply with, and to
provide a reason for omission and required explanation, as set out in GRI 1. See Requirement 6
in GRI 1 for more information on reasons for omission.
If complete reporting for a tax jurisdiction is not possible because the organization holds a
minority shareholding or is the non-operating joint venture partner in an entity, the organization
may provide ‘information unavailable / incomplete’ as the reason for omission and specify the
majority shareholder or operating partner.
The organization can also report any contextual information necessary to understand how data
has been compiled, such as any standards, methodologies, and assumptions used.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-i
Disclosure 207-4-b-i requires the organization to report a list of entities by tax jurisdiction.
If the organization’s publicly available audited consolidated financial statements, or the financial
information filed on public record, include a list of all its entities by tax jurisdiction, the
organization can provide a reference to this information.
When reporting the names of the resident entities for a tax jurisdiction, the organization can
specify if any of the entities are dormant.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-ii
When reporting its primary activities in a tax jurisdiction, the organization can provide a general
description such that a report reader can clearly identify the organization’s main activities in the
jurisdiction, for example, sales, marketing, manufacturing, or distribution. The organization is not
required to list the activities of each entity in the jurisdiction.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-iii
Employee numbers can be reported using an appropriate calculation, such as head count at the
end of the time period reported in Disclosure 207-4-c or a full-time equivalent (FTE) calculation.
To enable comparability, it is important that the organization applies the approach consistently
across all tax jurisdictions and between time periods.
If the organization is unable to report exact figures, it can report the number of employees to the
nearest ten or, where the number of employees is greater than 1000, to the nearest 100.
The number of employees is one indicator of the organization’s scale of activity in a tax
jurisdiction. In addition to the number of employees, the organization may report the number of
workers (excluding employees) performing the organization’s activities, if this helps explain the
14 GRI 207: Tax 2019
organization’s scale of activity in the jurisdiction. It is important that the organization reports the
number of employees and/or the number of workers consistently across all jurisdictions and
between time periods.
Guidance for Disclosures 207-4-b-iv and 207-4-b-v
These disclosures require the organization to report revenues from third-party sales for each tax
jurisdiction and from intra-group transactions between that jurisdiction and other tax
jurisdictions. Intra-group transactions within the same tax jurisdiction are not required, but the
organization can report this information separately.
Intra-group transactions between jurisdictions can influence the tax bases of the organization in
the jurisdictions involved in these transactions. Intra-group transactions within the same tax
jurisdiction do not affect the tax base of the organization within that jurisdiction.
For this reason, revenues from third-party sales and intra-group transactions with other
jurisdictions are a more appropriate indicator of an organization’s scale of activity in a tax
jurisdiction than aggregated revenues. Aggregated revenues could result in local revenues
being double-counted, which might create a misleading impression about the organization's
scale of activity in a jurisdiction.
The organization can also report other sources of revenue, for example, dividends, interest, and
royalties, where this is standard practice in the sector of the organization.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-vi
When reporting profit/loss before tax for a tax jurisdiction, the organization can calculate the
consolidated profit/loss before tax for all its resident entities in the jurisdiction.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-vii
When reporting tangible assets for a tax jurisdiction, the organization can calculate the
consolidated total of the net book values of tangible assets for all its resident entities in the
jurisdiction.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-viii
When reporting corporate income tax paid on a cash basis for a tax jurisdiction, the organization
can calculate the total actual corporate income tax paid during the time period reported in
Disclosure 207-4-c by all its resident entities in the jurisdiction. This includes cash taxes paid by
entities to the jurisdiction of residence and to all other jurisdictions (e.g., withholding taxes
incurred in other tax jurisdictions).
If the tax paid includes a significant amount of withholding tax, the organization can explain this.
If taxes are incurred in other tax jurisdictions, the organization can report the amount of tax paid
to the other tax jurisdictions separately and identify the jurisdictions where the tax was paid.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-b-x
When reporting the reasons for the difference between corporate income tax accrued on
profit/loss and the tax due if the statutory tax rate is applied to profit/loss before tax, the
organization can describe items that explain the difference, such as tax reliefs, allowances,
incentives, or any special tax provisions where an entity benefits from preferential tax treatment.
The organization can group explanatory items into a generic category, such as ‘other’, if these
items together do not exceed 10% of the difference.
The organization can also report the expiration date, investment requirements, and likely long-
term continuity of tax reliefs or incentives for a jurisdiction.
In addition to providing a qualitative explanation as required by this disclosure, the organization
can also report a quantitative corporate tax reconciliation.
Guidance for Disclosure 207-4-c and clause 2.1
The organization is required to report information on a regular schedule and make it available in
time for information users to make decisions (see the Timeliness principle in GRI 1: Foundation
2021 for more information). The organization is also recommended to report the information for
the same reporting period and publish the information at the same time as its financial
reporting, where this is possible (see section 5.1 in GRI 1 for more information). However, the
15 GRI 207: Tax 2019
information required in Disclosure 207-4 might not be available for reporting until a later point in

When providing information for stateless entities, the organization can also include their
jurisdiction of incorporation.
Guidance for clause 2.3.1

When reporting significant uncertain tax positions for a tax jurisdiction, the organization can
report the value of the tax positions in line with its audited consolidated financial statements or
the financial information filed on public record.
The organization can provide a description of tax positions that have not been agreed with the
relevant tax authorities at the end of the time period reported in Disclosure 207-4-c. The
