Introduction
GRI 406: Non-discrimination 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their impacts
related to discrimination, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its
discrimination-related impacts.
• Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s discrimination-related
impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of non-discrimination.
For the purpose of this Standard, discrimination is defined as the act and the result of treating people unequally by
imposing unequal burdens or denying benefits, instead of treating each person fairly on the basis of individual merit.
Discrimination can also include harassment. This is defined as a course of comments or actions that are
unwelcome, or should reasonably be known to be unwelcome, to the person towards whom they are addressed.
An organization is expected to avoid discriminating against any person on any grounds, including avoiding
discrimination against workers at work. It is also expected to avoid discriminating against customers with respect to
the provision of products and services, or against any other stakeholder, including suppliers or business partners.
These concepts are covered in key instruments of the International Labour Organization, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations (UN): see the Bibliography.
A number of international conventions and declarations address discrimination against specific groups of people or
on specific grounds. Examples include the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against
Women (CEDAW) and the UN International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
5 GRI 406: Non-discrimination 2016
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its impacts related to discrimination.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined non-discrimination to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s discrimination-related impacts
(Disclosure 406-1).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
6 GRI 406: Non-discrimination 2016
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.

1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined non-discrimination to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the
topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages non-discrimination using

2. Topic disclosures
Disclosure 406-1 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions
taken
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Total number of incidents of discrimination during the reporting period.
b. Status of the incidents and actions taken with reference to the following:
i. Incident reviewed by the organization;
ii. Remediation plans being implemented;
iii. Remediation plans that have been implemented, with results reviewed
through routine internal management review processes;
iv. Incident no longer subject to action.
Compilation requirements
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 406-1, the reporting
organization shall include incidents of discrimination on grounds of race,
color, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction, or social origin as
defined by the ILO, or other relevant forms of discrimination involving
internal and/or external stakeholders across operations in the reporting
period.
Guidance for Disclosure 406-1
GUIDANCE
In the context of this disclosure, an ‘incident’ refers to a legal action or complaint registered with
the reporting organization or competent authorities through a formal process, or an instance of
non-compliance identified by the organization through established procedures. Established
procedures to identify instances of non-compliance can include management system audits,
formal monitoring programs, or grievance mechanisms.
An incident is no longer subject to action if it is resolved, the case is completed, or no further
action is required by the organization. For example, an incident for which no further action is
required can include cases that were withdrawn or where the underlying circumstances that led
to the incident no longer exist.
Background
According to ILO instruments, discrimination can occur on the grounds of race, color, sex,
religion, political opinion, national extraction, and social origin. Discrimination can also occur
based on factors such as age, disability, migrant status, HIV and AIDS, gender, sexual
orientation, genetic predisposition, and lifestyles, among others.1
The presence and effective implementation of policies to avoid discrimination are a basic
expectation of responsible business conduct.
