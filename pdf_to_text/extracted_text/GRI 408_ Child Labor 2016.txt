Introduction
GRI 408: Child Labor 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their impacts related to
child labor, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts
related to child labor.
• Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s impacts related to child
labor.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of child labor. Abolishing child labor is a key principle and objective of major
human rights instruments and legislation, and is the subject of national legislation in almost all countries.
Child labor is work that ‘deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to their
physical or mental development including by interfering with their education. Specifically, it means types of work that
are not permitted for children below the relevant minimum age.’1
Child labor does not refer to youth employment or to children working. It refers to a universally-recognized human
rights abuse. The internationally-agreed understanding of the meaning of child labor is set out in the International
Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 138 ‘Minimum Age Convention’.
The minimum age for hazardous work is 18 years for all countries. Hazardous child labor is defined by Article 3 (d) of
ILO Convention 182 ‘Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention’ as ‘work which, by its nature or the circumstances in
which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.’
Due diligence is expected of an organization in order to prevent the use of child labor in its activities. It is also
expected to avoid contributing to, or becoming complicit in, the use of child labor through its relationships with others
(e.g., suppliers, clients).
These concepts are covered in key instruments of the ILO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to

report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its impacts related to child labor.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined child labor to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s impacts related to child labor
(Disclosure 408-1).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
6 GRI 408: Child Labor 2016
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.

1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined child labor to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic
using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.

2. Topic disclosures
Disclosure 408-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for
incidents of child labor
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Operations and suppliers considered to have significant risk for incidents of:
i. child labor;
ii. young workers exposed to hazardous work.
b. Operations and suppliers considered to have significant risk for incidents of child labor
either in terms of:
i. type of operation (such as manufacturing plant) and supplier;
ii. countries or geographic areas with operations and suppliers considered at risk.
c. Measures taken by the organization in the reporting period intended to contribute to the
effective abolition of child labor.
Guidance for Disclosure 408-1
GUIDANCE
The process for identifying operations and suppliers, as specified in Disclosure 408-1, can
reflect the reporting organization’s approach to risk assessment on this issue. It can also draw
from recognized international data sources, such as the ILO Information and reports on the
application of Conventions and Recommendations (see reference [1] in the Bibliography).
When reporting the measures taken, the organization can refer to the ILO ‘Tripartite Declaration
of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy’ and Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises for further guidance.
In the context of the GRI Standards, a ‘young worker’ is defined as a person above the
applicable minimum working age and younger than 18 years of age. Note that Disclosure 408-1
does not require quantitative reporting on child labor or the number of young workers. Rather, it
asks for reporting on the operations and suppliers considered to have significant risk for
incidents of child labor or young workers exposed to hazardous work.
Background
Child labor is subject to ILO Conventions 138 ‘Minimum Age Convention’ (ILO Convention 138)
and 182 ‘Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention’ (ILO Convention 182).
‘Child labor’ refers to an abuse, which is not to be confused with ‘children working’ or with
‘young persons working’, which may not be abuses as stipulated in ILO Convention 138.
The minimum age for working differs by country. ILO Convention 138 specifies a minimum age
of 15 years or the age of completion of compulsory schooling (whichever is higher). However,
there is an exception for certain countries where economies and educational facilities are
insufficiently developed and a minimum age of 14 years might apply. These countries of
exception are specified by the ILO in response to special application by the country concerned,
and in consultation with representative organizations of employers and workers.
ILO Convention 138 stipulates that ‘national laws or regulations may permit the employment or
work of persons 13 to 15 years of age on light work which is (a) not likely to be harmful to their
health or development; and (b) not such as to prejudice their attendance at school, their
participation in vocational orientation or training programmes approved by the competent
authority or their capacity to benefit from the instruction received’.
While child labor takes many different forms, a priority is to eliminate without delay the worst
forms of child labor as defined by Article 3 of ILO Convention 182. This includes all forms of
slavery or practices similar to slavery (such as sale, trafficking, forced or compulsory labor,
9 GRI 408: Child Labor 2016
serfdom, recruitment for armed conflict); the use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution
or illicit activities and any work that is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children. ILO
Convention 182 is intended to set priorities for states; however, organizations are expected not
to use this convention to justify forms of child labor.
Child labor results in under-skilled and unhealthy workers for tomorrow and perpetuates poverty
across generations, thus impeding sustainable development. The abolition of child labor is
therefore necessary for both economic and human development.
