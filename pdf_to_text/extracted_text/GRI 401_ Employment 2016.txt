Introduction
GRI 401: Employment 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their employment-
related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its
employment-related impacts.
• Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s employment-related
impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of employment. This includes an organization’s approach to employment or job
creation, that is, an organization’s approach to hiring, recruitment, retention and related practices, and the working
conditions it provides. The Standard also covers the employment and working conditions in an organization’s supply
chain.
An employment relationship is a legal relationship between a worker and an organization that confers rights and
obligations to both parties. This relationship is usually the means for determining whether employment or labor law is
applicable or whether commercial law is applicable.
These concepts are covered in key instruments of the International Labour Organization, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its employment-related impacts. In addition to this Standard, conditions of
work are also covered in detail in other GRI Standards:
• GRI 402: Labor/Management Relations 2016
• GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018
• GRI 404: Training and Education 2016
• GRI 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity 2016
• GRI 406: Non-discrimination 2016
In addition, Disclosure 2-7 and Disclosure 2-8 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 require information on employees
and other workers performing work for the organization, such as the total number of employees, and the total number
of permanent and temporary employees, by gender and by region.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined employment to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s employment-related impacts
(Disclosure 401-1 through Disclosure 401-3).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
6 GRI 401: Employment 2016
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
7 GRI 401: Employment 2016
1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined employment to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic
using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages employment using Disclosure
REQUIREMENTS
3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
1.2 The reporting organization should describe:
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.2.1 its policies or practices covering the relationships under which work is performed
for the organization;
1.2.2 actions taken to determine and address situations where work undertaken within
its supply chain does not take place within appropriate institutional and legal
frameworks;
1.2.3 actions taken to determine and address situations where persons working for
suppliers are not provided the social and labor protection that they are entitled to
receive by national labor law;
1.2.4 actions taken to determine and address situations where working conditions in
its supply chain do not meet international labor standards or national labor law;
1.2.5 actions taken to determine and address situations where work undertaken in its
supply chain is inadequately remunerated;
1.2.6 actions taken to determine and address situations of disguised employment
relationships where workers in its supply chain are falsely considered to be self-
employed or where there is no legally recognized employer;
1.2.7 actions taken to determine and address situations where work undertaken in its
supply chain that is performed at home is not subject to legally recognized
contracts.
Guidance for clause 1.2
GUIDANCE
Policies or practices covering the relationships under which work is performed for an
organization can include recognized employment relationships, the use of employees of other
organizations (such as workers supplied by agencies), and the extent to which work is
performed on a temporary or part-time basis. A description of policies and practices can include
policies and practices with respect to discrimination, compensation, promotion, privacy, human
resource development and industrial relations.
Work taking place within an appropriate institutional and legal framework usually entails a
recognized employment relationship with an identifiable and legally recognized employer.
Conditions of work can include compensation, working time, rest periods, holidays, disciplinary
and dismissal practices, maternity protection, the workplace environment, and occupational
health and safety. They can also include the quality of living accommodations where provided,
and welfare matters, such as safe drinking water, canteens and access to medical services.
Adequately remunerated work is work where wages and compensation for a standard working
week, excluding overtime, meet legal and industry minimum standards, and are sufficient to
meet the basic needs of workers and their families, and to provide them with some discretionary
income. Actions taken to address situations where work is inadequately remunerated can
include:
• dialogue with suppliers regarding the relationship of the prices paid to suppliers and the
wages paid to workers;
• changes to an organization’s procurement practices;
• support for collective bargaining to determine wages;
• determining the extent that overtime is used, whether it is mandatory, and whether it is
compensated at a premium rate.

2. Topic disclosures
Disclosure 401-1 New employee hires and employee turnover
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Total number and rate of new employee hires during the reporting period, by age group,
gender and region.
b. Total number and rate of employee turnover during the reporting period, by age group,
gender and region.
Compilation requirements
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 401-1, the reporting
organization shall use the total employee numbers at the end of the reporting period
to calculate the rates of new employee hires and employee turnover. See Standard
Interpretations.
2.2 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 401-1, the reporting organization
RECOMMENDATIONS
should use data from Disclosure 2-7 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 to identify the
total number of employees.
Guidance for Disclosure 401-1
GUIDANCE
An organization can use the following age groups:
• Under 30 years old;
• 30-50 years old;
• Over 50 years old.
Background
The number, age, gender, and region of an organization’s new employee hires can indicate its
strategy and ability to attract diverse, qualified employees. This information can signify the
organization’s efforts to implement inclusive recruitment practices based on age and gender. It
can also signify the optimal use of available labor and talent in different regions.
A high rate of employee turnover can indicate levels of uncertainty and dissatisfaction among
employees. It can also signal a fundamental change in the structure of an organization’s core
operations. An uneven pattern of turnover by age or gender can indicate incompatibility or
potential inequity in the workplace. Turnover results in changes to the human and intellectual
capital of the organization and can impact productivity. Turnover has direct cost implications
either in terms of reduced payroll or greater expenses for the recruitment of employees.
9 GRI 401: Employment 2016
Disclosure 401-2 Benefits provided to full-time employees that are
not provided to temporary or part-time employees
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Benefits which are standard for full-time employees of the organization but are not
provided to temporary or part-time employees, by significant locations of operation.
These include, as a minimum:
i. life insurance;
ii. health care;
iii. disability and invalidity coverage;
iv. parental leave;
v. retirement provision;
vi. stock ownership;
vii. others.
b. The definition used for ‘significant locations of operation’.
Compilation requirements
2.3 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 401-2, the reporting
organization shall exclude in-kind benefits such as provision of sports or child day
care facilities, free meals during working time, and similar general employee welfare
programs.
Background
GUIDANCE
Data reported under this disclosure provide a measure of an organization’s investment in
human resources and the minimum benefits it offers its full-time employees. The quality of
benefits for full-time employees is a key factor in retaining employees.
10 GRI 401: Employment 2016
Disclosure 401-3 Parental leave
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Total number of employees that were entitled to parental leave, by gender.
b. Total number of employees that took parental leave, by gender.
c. Total number of employees that returned to work in the reporting period after parental
leave ended, by gender.
d. Total number of employees that returned to work after parental leave ended that were
still employed 12 months after their return to work, by gender.
e. Return to work and retention rates of employees that took parental leave, by gender.
2.4 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 401-3, the reporting organization
RECOMMENDATIONS
should use the following formulas to calculate the return to work and retention rates:
Total number of employees that did return to work after
parental leave
Return to work ___________________________________________
= x 100
rate
Total number of employees due to return to work after
taking parental leave
Total number of employees retained 12 months after
returning to work following a period of parental leave
___________________________________________
Retention rate = x 100
Total number of employees returning from parental
leave in the prior reporting period(s)
Guidance for Disclosure 401-3
GUIDANCE
Employees entitled to parental leave means those employees that are covered by organizational
policies, agreements or contracts that contain parental leave entitlements.
To determine who returned to work after parental leave ended and were still employed 12
months later, an organization can consult records from the prior reporting periods.
Background
Many countries have introduced legislation to provide parental leave. The aim of the legislation
is to allow employees to take leave and return to work in the same or a comparable position.
The application of legislation varies according to interpretation by government, employers and
employees. Many women are discouraged from taking leave and returning to work by employer
practices that affect their employment security, remuneration and career path. Many men are not
encouraged to take the leave to which they are entitled.
Equitable gender choice for maternity and paternity leave, and other leave entitlements, can lead
to the greater recruitment and retention of qualified employees. It can also boost employee
morale and productivity. Men’s uptake of paternity leave options can indicate the degree to which
an organization encourages fathers to take such leave. Men taking advantage of leave
entitlements positively impacts women to take such leave without prejudicing their career path.

of the GSSB.
Relevant section
Clause 2.1 in GRI 401: Employment 2016
Issue
Disclosure 401-1 New employee hires and employee turnover in GRI 401: Employment 2016 requires organizations
to report the total numbers and rates of new employee hires and employee turnover during the reporting period, by
age group, gender and region.
Clause 2.1 in GRI 401 further requires organizations to use the total employee numbers at the end of the reporting
period to calculate the rates of new employee hires and employee turnover.
Feedback from users of the GRI Standards indicated that the required methodology in clause 2.1 is incorrect.
Interpretation Statement
An organization is not required to comply with clause 2.1 in GRI 401: Employment 2016 (‘The reporting organization
shall use the total employee numbers at the end of the reporting period to calculate the rates of new employee hires
and employee turnover’).
The organization is free to choose the methodology for calculating these rates.
The organization is recommended to adequately describe data measurements and bases for calculations (see the
Accuracy principle in GRI 1: Foundation 2021). When using ratios or normalized data, the organization is
recommended to report total numbers or absolute data and provide explanatory notes (see the Comparability
principle in GRI 1).
Effective date
This Standard Interpretation is effective for reports or other materials published on or after 1 July 2018.
