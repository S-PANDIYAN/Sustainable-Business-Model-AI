Introduction
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures for organizations to provide information about their reporting
practices; activities and workers; governance; strategy, policies, and practices; and stakeholder engagement. This
information gives insight into the profile and scale of organizations and provides a context for understanding their
impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains five disclosures, which provide information about the organization, its sustainability reporting
practices, and the entities included in its sustainability reporting.
• Section 2 contains three disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s activities, employees,
and other workers.
• Section 3 contains thirteen disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s governance structure,
composition, roles, and remuneration.
• Section 4 contains seven disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s sustainable
development strategy and its policies and practices for responsible business conduct.
• Section 5 contains two disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s stakeholder engagement
practices and how it engages in collective bargaining with employees.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing
this Standard, as well as resources that the organization can consult.
The rest of the Introduction section provides an overview of the system of GRI Standards and further information on
using this Standard.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report all disclosures in this Standard.
Disclosure 2-2 in this Standard requires the organization to list its entities included in its sustainability reporting.
These entities define the scope for reporting all other disclosures in this Standard.
Reasons for omission are permitted for all disclosures in this Standard except for:
• Disclosure 2-1 Organizational details
• Disclosure 2-2 Entities included in the organization’s sustainability reporting
• Disclosure 2-3 Reporting period, frequency and contact point
• Disclosure 2-4 Restatements of information
• Disclosure 2-5 External assurance
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure for which reasons for
omission are permitted (e.g., because the required information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the
organization is required to specify the disclosure or the requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for
omission together with an explanation in the GRI content index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for
more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
7 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout the GRI Standards:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
8 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
1. The organization and its reporting practices
The disclosures in this section provide an overview of the organization, its sustainability reporting practices, and the
entities included in its sustainability reporting.
Disclosure 2-1 Organizational details
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report its legal name;
b. report its nature of ownership and legal form;
c. report the location of its headquarters;
d. report its countries of operation.
Guidance to 2-1-a
GUIDANCE
If the organization uses a commonly known trading name or business name that is different
from its legal name, it should report this in addition to its legal name.
Guidance to 2-1-b
The nature of ownership and the legal form of the organization refers to whether it is publicly or
privately owned, and whether it is an incorporated entity, a partnership, a sole proprietorship, or
another type of entity such as a nonprofit, an association, or a charity.
Guidance to 2-1-c
Headquarters are an organization’s global administrative center, the place from which it is
controlled or directed.
Guidance to 2-1-d
If the organization has reported its countries of operation elsewhere, such as in its audited
consolidated financial statements or financial information filed on public record, the organization
can provide a link or reference to this information. The organization can also report the regions
or specific locations within countries (e.g., states, cities) where it has operations, if this provides
contextual information for understanding the organization’s impacts.
9 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-2 Entities included in the organization’s sustainability
reporting
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. list all its entities included in its sustainability reporting;
b. if the organization has audited consolidated financial statements or financial
information filed on public record, specify the differences between the list of entities
included in its financial reporting and the list included in its sustainability reporting;
c. if the organization consists of multiple entities, explain the approach used for
consolidating the information, including:
i. whether the approach involves adjustments to information for minority interests;
ii. how the approach takes into account mergers, acquisitions, and disposal of
entities or parts of entities;
iii. whether and how the approach differs across the disclosures in this Standard and
across material topics.
Guidance to 2-2-a
GUIDANCE
The entities reported under 2-2-a form the basis for reporting the disclosures in this Standard
and for determining the organization’s material topics.
Requirement 2-2-a includes those entities that the organization controls or has an interest in
and are included in its sustainability reporting, such as subsidiaries, joint ventures, and
affiliates, including minority interests. The organization should report information for the same
group of entities as covered in its financial reporting.
When determining its material topics, the organization should consider the impacts of additional
entities with which it has business relationships that are not included in the list reported under
2-2-a. See section 1 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for more information.
Guidance to 2-2-a and 2-2-b
If all the entities in the organization’s financial reporting are also included in its sustainability
reporting, a brief statement of this fact, including a link or reference to the list of entities included
in its audited consolidated financial statements or financial information filed on public record, is
sufficient to comply with 2-2-a and 2-2-b.
The organization should separately specify any additional entities included in the sustainability
reporting that are not included in its financial reporting.
Guidance to 2-2-c
A minority interest is an ownership interest in an entity that is not controlled by the parent entity.
10 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-3 Reporting period, frequency and contact point
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. specify the reporting period for, and the frequency of, its sustainability reporting;
b. specify the reporting period for its financial reporting and, if it does not align with the
period for its sustainability reporting, explain the reason for this;
c. report the publication date of the report or reported information;
d. specify the contact point for questions about the report or reported information.
Guidance to 2-3-a
GUIDANCE
The organization can specify the frequency of sustainability reporting as ‘annual’. See the
Timeliness principle in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information.
Guidance to 2-3-a and 2-3-b
The reporting period refers to the time period covered by the reported information and should
include the start and end dates (e.g., 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, 1 July 2022 through
30 June 2023).
The organization should report the information for the same reporting period as covered in its
financial reporting. The organization should also publish the information at the same time as its
financial reporting, where this is possible.
11 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-4 Restatements of information
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report restatements of information made from previous reporting periods and explain:
i. the reasons for the restatements;
ii. the effect of the restatements.
The organization should provide a restatement of information when it has learned that the
GUIDANCE
previously reported information needs to be revised. Restatements of information from previous
reporting periods can correct an error, or account for changes in measurement methodology or
to the nature of the business. Restatements of information ensure consistency and enable
comparability of information between reporting periods. See the Comparability principle in GRI
1: Foundation 2021 for more information.
The organization should report the criteria used to determine when a change or error in
previously reported information is considered significant enough to provide a restatement. A
change or error could be significant when it influences information users’ decision-making (e.g.,
it influences the analysis of the changes in the organization’s impacts over time).
For example, if an organization adopts a new, more accurate method for measuring greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions, it may subsequently experience a reduction in its previously reported
GHG emissions that meets the organization’s restatement criteria. The organization then
restates its previously reported GHG emissions. In such a case, the organization is required to
explain that it has restated its previously reported GHG emissions due to the new measurement
methodology and that this has resulted in lower GHG emissions than previously reported. The
organization should also report the quantitative change observed (e.g., GHG emissions are 10%
lower than the emissions previously reported).
If the organization has not made any restatement in the reporting period, a brief statement of this
fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement.
Guidance to 2-4-a-i
Examples of reasons for restatements of information include:
• change of base period or length of the reporting period;
• change in the nature of the business;
• change in the measurement methodologies or in the definitions used;
• disposals, mergers, or acquisitions;
• error made in previous reporting periods.
Guidance to 2-4-a-ii
The effect of the restatement refers to the consequences of the change or correction made to
previously reported information. If the restatement relates to quantitative information, the
organization should specify the quantitative change in the restated information (e.g., GHG
emissions are 10% lower compared to the level of emissions previously reported).
12 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-5 External assurance
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. describe its policy and practice for seeking external assurance, including whether and
how the highest governance body and senior executives are involved;
b. if the organization’s sustainability reporting has been externally assured:
i. provide a link or reference to the external assurance report(s) or assurance
statement(s);
ii. describe what has been assured and on what basis, including the assurance
standards used, the level of assurance obtained, and any limitations of the
assurance process;
iii. describe the relationship between the organization and the assurance provider.
See section 5.2 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for information on external assurance.
GUIDANCE
Guidance to 2-5-b-ii
If this information is covered in the external assurance reports or statements that the
organization has provided a link or a reference to under 2-5-b-i, then a brief statement of this fact
is sufficient to comply with the requirement.
The organization can also describe, in accessible language:
• the scope of information and processes covered;
• the responsibilities of the organization relative to the assurance provider;
• the opinion or conclusions formally signed off by the assurance provider;
• a summary of the work performed;
• information on the experience and qualifications of the assurance provider, e.g., profile and
level of subject matter expertise of the individuals involved.
Guidance to 2-5-b-iii
An assurance provider conducting external assurance needs to demonstrate independence
from the organization to reach and publish objective and impartial conclusions about the
organization’s sustainability reporting.
13 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
2. Activities and workers
The disclosures in this section provide an overview of the organization’s activities, employees, and other workers.
Disclosure 2-6 Activities, value chain and other business
relationships
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report the sector(s) in which it is active;
b. describe its value chain, including:
i. the organization’s activities, products, services, and markets served;
ii. the organization’s supply chain;
iii. the entities downstream from the organization and their activities;
c. report other relevant business relationships;
d. describe significant changes in 2-6-a, 2-6-b, and 2-6-c compared to the previous
reporting period.
Guidance to 2-6-a
GUIDANCE
Sectors can be identified according to categories, such as the public or private sector; or
industry-specific categories, such as the education sector or the financial sector.
Depending on the organization’s activities, sectors can be identified using the GRI Sector
Standards or classification systems such as the Global Industry Classification Standard
(GICS®), the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB), the International Standard Industrial
Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), and the Sustainable Industry Classification
System (SICS®).
Guidance to 2-6-b
The organization’s value chain includes the range of activities carried out by the organization,
and by entities upstream and downstream from the organization, to bring the organization’s
products or services from their conception to their end use. Entities upstream from the
organization provide products or services used in the development of the organization’s own
products or services. Entities downstream from the organization are those that receive products
or services from the organization. Entities in the value chain include entities beyond the first tier,
both upstream and downstream.
The information reported under 2-6-b provides a context for understanding the
organization’s impacts across its value chain, including through the use of its products and
services. Describing the markets served provides further information on the groups of
customers targeted by the organization’s products and services.
The organization is not required to provide a detailed description of each activity in its value
chain. Instead, it can provide a high-level overview of its value chain.
Guidance to 2-6-b-i
When describing its activities, the organization should report its total number of operations and
explain how it defines ‘operation’.
When describing its products and services, the organization should report:
• the quantity of products or services provided during the reporting period (e.g., number of
products or services provided, net sales of products or services provided);
• whether it sells products or services that are banned in certain markets or are the subject of
stakeholder concerns or public debate, including the reason for the ban or concerns and
how the organization has responded to these concerns.
14 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
When describing the markets served, the organization can report:
• the geographic locations where products and services are offered;
• the demographic or other characteristics of the markets;
• information on the size and relative importance of the markets (e.g., net sales, net revenues).
Guidance to 2-6-b-ii
The organization can describe:
• the types of suppliers (e.g., brokers, contractors, wholesalers);
• the estimated number of suppliers throughout its supply chain and in each tier (e.g., first tier,
second tier);
• the types of activities related to the organization’s products and services carried out by its
suppliers (e.g., manufacturing, providing consulting services);
• the nature of its business relationships with its suppliers (e.g., long-term or short-term,
contractual or non-contractual, project-based or event-based);
• the sector-specific characteristics of its supply chain (e.g., labor-intensive);
• the estimated monetary value of payments made to its suppliers;
• the geographic location of its suppliers.
Guidance to 2-6-b-iii
The organization can describe:
• the types of downstream entities (e.g., customers, beneficiaries);
• the estimated number of downstream entities;
• the types of activities related to the organization’s products and services carried out by the
downstream entities (e.g., manufacturing, wholesale, retail);
• the nature of its business relationships with the downstream entities (e.g., long-term or
short-term, contractual or non-contractual, project-based or event-based);
• the geographic location of the downstream entities.
Guidance to 2-6-c
Other relevant business relationships include relationships that the organization has with
entities that are not described as part of its value chain under 2-6-b. These may
include business partners (e.g., joint ventures) and other entities directly linked to the
organization’s operations, products, or services (for examples, see the note in the definition of
‘business relationships’).
The organization can report the types of entities, their activities, and their geographic location.
Guidance to 2-6-d
Requirement 2-6-d entails describing significant changes in the organization’s sectors, value
chain, and other business relationships compared to the previous reporting period. This
information can help explain changes to the organization’s impacts. Examples of significant
changes that can be reported under this disclosure are changes in activities such as the
opening, closing, or expansion of facilities; changes in the structure of the organization’s supply
chain or in its relationships with suppliers, including selection and termination; or changes in
the location of its suppliers.
15 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-7 Employees
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report the total number of employees, and a breakdown of this total by gender and by
region;
b. report the total number of:
i. permanent employees, and a breakdown by gender and by region;
ii. temporary employees, and a breakdown by gender and by region;
iii. non-guaranteed hours employees, and a breakdown by gender and by region;
iv. full-time employees, and a breakdown by gender and by region;
v. part-time employees, and a breakdown by gender and by region;
c. describe the methodologies and assumptions used to compile the data, including
whether the numbers are reported:
i. in head count, full-time equivalent (FTE), or using another methodology;
ii. at the end of the reporting period, as an average across the reporting period, or
using another methodology;
d. report contextual information necessary to understand the data reported under 2-7-a
and 2-7-b;
e. describe significant fluctuations in the number of employees during the reporting period
and between reporting periods.
Together with Disclosure 2-8, this disclosure gives insight into the organization’s approach to
GUIDANCE
employment, including the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices. It
also provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the information reported in
other disclosures, and serves as the basis for calculation in other disclosures, such as
Disclosure 2-21 Annual total compensation ratio and Disclosure 2-30 Collective bargaining
agreements in this Standard.
This disclosure covers all employees who perform work for any of the organization’s entities
included in its sustainability reporting as reported under Disclosure 2-2 in this Standard.
See references [7], [19], [22], [23], [24], [26], and [30] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 2-7-a
An employee is an individual who is in an employment relationship with the organization
according to national law or practice.
Providing a breakdown of employees by gender gives insight into gender representation across
the organization. Providing a breakdown of employees by region gives insight into regional
variations. A region can refer to a country or other geographic locations, such as a city or a world
region.
See Table 1 and Table 2 of this Standard for examples of how to present this information.
Guidance to 2-7-b
The definitions of permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time
employees differ between countries. If the organization has employees in more than one
country, it should use the definitions as per the national laws of the countries where the
employees are based to calculate country-level data. The country-level data should then be
added up to calculate total numbers, disregarding differences in national legal definitions.
Non-guaranteed hours employees are employed by the organization without a guarantee of a
minimum or fixed number of working hours. The employee may need to make themselves
available for work as required, but the organization is not contractually obligated to offer the
employee a minimum or fixed number of working hours per day, week, or month. Casual
employees, employees with zero-hour contracts, and on-call employees are examples that fall
under this category.
16 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
If the organization is unable to report exact figures, it can report estimates of the number of
employees to the nearest ten or, where the number of employees is greater than 1,000, to the
nearest 100, and explain this under 2-7-c.
See Table 1 and Table 2 of this Standard for examples of how to present this information.
Guidance to 2-7-c
The organization can report the total number of employees and the number of permanent,
temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time employees in head count or full-time
equivalent (FTE). Reporting these numbers in head count gives insight into the number of
individual employees, whether full-time or part-time employed. Reporting these numbers in FTE
gives insight into the hours worked.
The organization can use another methodology for reporting these numbers.
Reporting the number of employees at the end of the reporting period provides information for
that point in time, without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Reporting these
numbers in averages across the reporting period takes into account fluctuations during the
reporting period.
Guidance to 2-7-d
Quantitative data, such as the number of temporary or part-time employees, is unlikely to be
sufficient on its own. For example, a high proportion of temporary or part-time employees could
indicate lack of employment security for employees, but it could equally signal workplace
flexibility when offered as a voluntary choice. For this reason, the organization is required to
report contextual information to help information users interpret the data.
The organization can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An example of such a
reason is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a temporary or seasonal project or
event. Another example is the standard practice to offer a temporary contract (e.g., six months) to
new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made. The organization can also
explain the reasons for non-guaranteed hours employment.
The organization can explain how it defines full-time employment. If the organization has
employees in more than one country, it can report the definitions of full-time employment it uses
for the regions that cover these countries. The organization can also explain the reasons for
part-time employment. Examples of such reasons are to accommodate employees’ requests to
work reduced hours, or because the organization is unable to provide full-time employment to all
employees.
If there are differences in permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time
employment between genders or between regions, the organization can explain the reasons for
these differences.
Guidance to 2-7-e
Requirement 2-7-e enables the organization to explain how the numbers of employees vary
during the reporting period compared to the previous reporting periods (i.e., whether the
numbers have increased or decreased). It can also include the reasons for the fluctuations. For
example, an increase in the number of employees during the reporting period could be due to a
seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of employees compared to the previous
reporting period could be due to the completion of a temporary project.
It is up to the organization to determine which fluctuations in the number of employees it
considers significant to report under 2-7-e. The organization should report its threshold for
determining significant fluctuations.
If there are no significant fluctuations in the number of employees during the reporting period or
between reporting periods, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the
requirement.

organization;
ii. the type of work they perform;

whether the number of workers who are not employees is reported:
i. in head count, full-time equivalent (FTE), or using another methodology;
ii. at the end of the reporting period, as an average across the reporting period, or
using another methodology;
c. describe significant fluctuations in the number of workers who are not employees
during the reporting period and between reporting periods.
This disclosure provides an understanding of how much the organization relies on workers who
GUIDANCE
are not employees to perform its work, in comparison to employees. This information is
important for understanding how many workers in total perform work for the organization,
because workers who are not employees are not represented in employment figures reported
under Disclosure 2-7.
Disclosure 2-8, together with Disclosure 2-7, gives insight into the organization’s approach to
employment, as well as the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices.
It also provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the information reported in
other disclosures.
This disclosure covers all workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by any
of the organization’s entities included in its sustainability reporting as reported under Disclosure
2-2 in this Standard.
If all the workers performing work for the organization are employees and the organization does
not have any workers who are not employees, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply
with the requirements under this disclosure.
See references [7], [19], [22], [23], [24], [26], and [30] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 2-8-a
Workers who are not employees are those who perform work for the organization but are not in
an employment relationship with the organization.
This disclosure requires the organization to report the number of workers who are not
employees and whose work is controlled by the organization. Control of work implies that the
organization directs the work performed or has control over the means or methods for
performing the work.
The organization might have sole control of the work or share control with one or more
organizations (e.g., suppliers, customers, or other business partners, such as in joint ventures).
Types of workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by the organization
include agency workers, apprentices, contractors, home workers, interns, self-employed
persons, sub-contractors, and volunteers. The organization should report how it has determined
when it has control of the work for workers who are not employees.
The following are examples of workers who are not employees and whose work is controlled by
the organization. The following workers are included under this disclosure:
• Contractors hired by the organization to perform work at the organization’s workplace, in a
public area (e.g., on a road), or directly at the workplace of the organization’s client.
• Workers of one of the organization’s suppliers, where the organization instructs the supplier
to use particular materials or work methods to manufacture the products or deliver the
19 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
services.
• Volunteers or interns performing work for the organization.
The following are examples of workers who are not employees and whose work is not
controlled by the organization. The following workers are not included under this disclosure:
• Workers of an equipment supplier to the organization who perform regular maintenance on
the supplier’s equipment (e.g., photocopy machines at the organization’s workplace) as
stipulated in the contract between the equipment supplier and the organization.
• Workers of one of the organization’s suppliers, if the organization sources standard products
manufactured using the supplier’s production methods (e.g., purchasing stationery that is a
standard product of the supplier).
If the organization cannot report exact figures, it can report estimates of the number of workers
who are not employees to the nearest ten or, where the number of workers who are not
employees is greater than 1,000, to the nearest 100, and explain this under 2-8-b.
Guidance to 2-8-a-i and 2-8-a-ii
When reporting its contractual relationship with the most common types of workers, the
organization should report whether it engages them directly or indirectly through a third party,
and in the latter case, who this third party is (e.g., employment agency, contractor).
It is sufficient that the organization provides a general description. The organization is not
required to report the type of worker, contractual relationship, and work performed for every
worker who is not an employee.
Guidance to 2-8-b
The organization can report the number of workers who are not employees in head count or full-
time equivalent (FTE). The head count gives insight into the number of individual workers,
whether on a full-time or part-time basis. The FTE gives insight into the hours worked. The
organization can use another methodology for reporting this number.
Reporting the number of workers who are not employees at the end of the reporting period
provides information for that point in time without capturing fluctuations during the reporting
period. Reporting this number as an average across the reporting period takes into account
fluctuations during the reporting period.
Guidance to 2-8-c
Requirement 2-8-c enables the organization to explain how the number of workers who are not
employees varies during the reporting period or compared to previous reporting periods (i.e.,
whether the numbers have increased or decreased). It can also include the reasons for the
fluctuations. For example, an increase in the number of workers who are not employees during
the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of
workers who are not employees compared to the previous reporting period could be due to the
completion of a temporary project.
It is up to the organization to determine which fluctuations in the number of workers it considers
significant to report under 2-8-c. The organization should report its threshold for determining
significant fluctuations.
If there are no significant fluctuations in the number of workers who are not employees during
the reporting period or between reporting periods, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to
comply with the requirement.
20 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
3. Governance
The disclosures in this section provide information about the organization’s governance structure, composition,
knowledge, roles, and remuneration.
The information reported under these disclosures is important for understanding how the management of the
organization’s impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, is
integrated into the organization’s strategy and operations. It addresses how the governance bodies are set up and
how well equipped they are to oversee the management of the organization’s impacts. It also facilitates an
understanding of the role and the responsibilities of governance bodies with respect to these impacts.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).

32 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-21 Annual total compensation ratio
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report the ratio of the annual total compensation for the organization’s highest-paid
individual to the median annual total compensation for all employees(excluding the
highest-paid individual);
b. report the ratio of the percentage increase in annual total compensation for the
organization’s highest-paid individual to the median percentage increase in annual total
compensation for all employees (excluding the highest-paid individual);
c. report contextual information necessary to understand the data and how the data has
been compiled.
Guidance to 2-21-a and 2-21-b
GUIDANCE
This disclosure covers all employees as reported under Disclosure 2-7 in this Standard.
Annual total compensation includes salary, bonus, stock awards, option awards, non-equity
incentive plan compensation, change in pension value, and nonqualified deferred
compensation earnings provided over the course of a year. When calculating the ratio, the
organization should, depending on the organization’s remuneration policies and availability of
data, consider all of the following:
• Base salary, which is the sum of guaranteed, short-term, and non-variable cash
compensation.
• Total cash compensation, which is the sum of the base salary and cash allowances,
bonuses, commissions, cash profit-sharing, and other forms of variable cash payments.
• Direct compensation, which is the sum of total cash compensation and total fair value of all
annual long-term incentives (e.g., stock option awards, restricted stock shares or units,
performance stock shares or units, phantom stock shares, stock appreciation rights, and
long-term cash awards).
The annual total compensation ratio can be calculated using the following formula:
Annual total compensation for the organization's highest paid-individual
_____________________________________________________________
Median annual total compensation for all of the organization's employees excluding the
highest-paid individual
The change in the annual total compensation ratio can be calculated using the following
formula:
Percentage increase in annual total compensation for the organization's highest-paid
individual
_____________________________________________________________
Median percentage increase in annual total compensation for all of the organization's
employees excluding the highest-paid individual
Guidance to 2-21-c
Quantitative data, such as the annual total compensation ratio, may not be sufficient on its own
to understand pay disparity and its drivers. For example, pay ratios can be influenced by the size
of the organization (e.g., revenue, number of employees), its sector, its employment strategy
(e.g., reliance on outsourced workers or part-time employees, a high degree of automation), or
currency volatility.
33 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
The difference in pay disparity reported over the years may be the result of a change in the
organization’s compensation policy or the level of compensation for its highest-paid individual or
employees, a change in calculation methodology (e.g., selection of the median annual total
compensation, inclusions or exclusions) or an improvement in data collection processes. For
this reason, the organization is required to report contextual information to help information
users interpret the data and understand how it has been compiled.
The organization should provide the following contextual information:
• Whether any employees reported under Disclosure 2-7 in this Standard have been excluded.
• Whether full-time equivalent (FTE) pay rates are used for each part-time employee.
• A list of the types of compensation included.
• The title of the highest-paid individual.
34 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
4. Strategy, policies and practices
The disclosures in this section provide information about the organization’s sustainable development strategy and its
policies and practices for responsible business conduct. The disclosures are based on expectations for businesses
contained in authoritative intergovernmental instruments.1
Expectations for responsible business conduct include complying with laws and regulations, respecting all
internationally recognized human rights, including workers' rights, and protecting the environment and public health
and safety. The expectations also cover combating bribery, bribe solicitation, extortion, and other forms of corruption;
adhering to good tax practices; and conducting due diligence to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for how the
organization addresses its negative impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their
human rights.
In the disclosures in this section, the organization is required to report information about its overall policies and
practices for responsible business conduct, rather than information for specific material topics. Disclosure 3-3 in GRI
3: Material Topics 2021 requires information about how the organization manages each material topic. If the
organization has described its policies and practices for a material topic under the disclosures in this section, it can
provide a reference to this information under Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3 and does not need to repeat the information.
Disclosure 2-22 Statement on sustainable development strategy
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report a statement from the highest governance body or most senior executive of the
organization about the relevance of sustainable development to the organization and its
strategy for contributing to sustainable development.
The organization should describe:
GUIDANCE
• its short, medium, and long-term vision and strategy to manage its impacts on the economy,
environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights, across the organization’s
activities and business relationships;
• how its purpose, business strategy, and business model aim to prevent negative impacts
and achieve positive impacts on the economy, environment, and people;
• its short and medium-term strategic priorities for contributing to sustainable development,
including how the priorities are aligned with authoritative intergovernmental instruments;
• the broader trends (e.g., macroeconomic, social, political) affecting the organization and its
strategy for contributing to sustainable development;
• the key events, achievements, and failures associated with the organization’s contribution to
sustainable development during the reporting period;
• a view of performance against goals and targets related to the organization’s material
topics during the reporting period;
• the organization’s main challenges, goals, and targets regarding its contribution to
sustainable development for the next year and the coming three to five years.
1 These instruments include the International Labour Organization (ILO) Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social
Policy [9]; the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises [12]; the OECD Due Diligence
Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct [11]; and the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [14]. These instruments
are in turn based on international legal instruments, such as the United Nations (UN) International Bill of Human Rights [15] and the ILO conventions.
35 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-23 Policy commitments
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. describe its policy commitments for responsible business conduct, including:
i. the authoritative intergovernmental instruments that the commitments reference;
ii. whether the commitments stipulate conducting due diligence;
iii. whether the commitments stipulate applying the precautionary principle;
iv. whether the commitments stipulate respecting human rights;
b. describe its specific policy commitment to respect human rights, including:
i. the internationally recognized human rights that the commitment covers;
ii. the categories of stakeholders, including at-risk or vulnerable groups, that the
organization gives particular attention to in the commitment;
c. provide links to the policy commitments if publicly available, or, if the policy
commitments are not publicly available, explain the reason for this;
d. report the level at which each of the policy commitments was approved within the
organization, including whether this is the most senior level;
e. report the extent to which the policy commitments apply to the organization’s activities
and to its business relationships;
f. describe how the policy commitments are communicated to workers, business
partners, and other relevant parties.
This disclosure covers the organization’s policy commitments for responsible business
GUIDANCE
conduct, including the commitment to respect human rights. These commitments can be set out
in a stand-alone policy document or be included within one or more other policy documents,
such as codes of conduct.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises [12], the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business
Conduct [11], and the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights [14] set out expectations for organizations in relation to these policy commitments.
Guidance to 2-23-a
The organization should report the expectations, values, principles, and norms of behavior set
out in the policy commitments.
The organization can also report how the policy commitments were developed, including the
internal and external expertise that informed the policy commitments.
Guidance to 2-23-a-i
See the Bibliography for a list of authoritative intergovernmental instruments for responsible
business conduct.
The organization can also make a reference to other standards or initiatives that it participates
in.
Guidance to 2-23-a-iii
The precautionary principle is set out in Principle 15 of the UN Rio Declaration on Environment
and Development [18]. It states: ‘Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack
of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to
prevent environmental degradation.’
The precautionary principle means taking early action to prevent and mitigate potential
negative impacts in situations where conclusive scientific understanding or evidence is lacking,
but there is sufficient reason to expect serious or irreversible damage.
While the precautionary principle is most often associated with the protection of the
environment, it can be applied to other areas, such as health and safety. The organization can
36 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
describe the areas where it applies the precautionary principle.
The application of the precautionary principle can be reported under 3-3-d-i in GRI 3: Material
Topics 2021, as part of the organization’s actions to prevent or mitigate potential negative
impacts for each material topic.
Guidance to 2-23-b-i
Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings and are all interrelated, interdependent,
and indivisible.
The internationally recognized human rights include, at a minimum, the rights set out in
the UN International Bill of Human Rights [15] and the principles concerning fundamental rights
set out in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles
and Rights at Work [5]. The UN International Bill of Human Rights consists of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional
Protocols.
Other UN instruments elaborate further on the rights of indigenous peoples; women; national or
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities; children; persons with disabilities; and migrant
workers and their families. There are also standards of international humanitarian law that apply
in situations of armed conflict, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
Geneva Conventions of 1949 [1].2
At the regional level, binding treaties as well as non-binding instruments provide region-specific
frameworks for human rights.3
If the policy commitment covers all internationally recognized human rights, a brief statement of
this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement. The organization can also state if the policy
commitment references certain rights that require particular attention. For example, an
organization can state that its policy commitment covers all internationally recognized human
rights, and also references the rights to privacy and freedom of expression in particular because
the organization has identified that its activities have an impact on these rights.
If the policy commitment covers only some internationally recognized human rights, the
organization is required to state the rights that are covered. It can explain why the policy
commitment is limited to these rights.
Guidance to 2-23-b-ii
Categories of stakeholders that the organization gives particular attention to can include
consumers, customers, employees and other workers, and local communities. They can also
include individuals belonging to groups or populations that are considered to be at risk or
vulnerable groups, such as children; human rights defenders; indigenous peoples; migrant
workers and their families; national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities; persons who
might be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
expression, or sex characteristics; persons with disabilities; or women.
For example, a bank may give particular attention in its policy commitment to avoid
discriminating against specific categories of customers, or a mining organization may give
particular attention to avoid infringing on the rights of indigenous peoples.
Guidance to 2-23-d
The most senior level may differ between organizations. For example, the most senior level in
an organization could be the highest governance body (e.g., the board) or the most senior
executive (e.g., chief executive officer).
The organization can also report the dates of approval and adoption of the policy commitments,
and how frequently the commitments are reviewed.

37 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Guidance to 2-23-e
If the policy commitments apply to all of the organization’s activities and business
relationships equally, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement.
If the policy commitments apply to only some of the organization’s activities (e.g., they apply only
to entities located in certain countries or to certain subsidiaries), the organization should report
which activities the commitments apply to. It can also explain why the commitments are limited
to these activities.
If the policy commitments apply to only some of the organization’s business relationships, the
organization should specify the types of business relationships the commitments apply to (e.g.,
distributors, franchisees, joint ventures, suppliers). It can also explain why the commitments are
limited to these business relationships. The organization should also explain whether the
business relationships are obligated to abide by the policy commitments or are encouraged
(but not obligated) to do so.
Guidance to 2-23-f
The organization can report:
• whether the policy commitments need to be read, agreed to, and regularly signed by all
workers, business partners, and other relevant parties, such as governance body members;
• the means through which it communicates the policy commitments (e.g., newsletters, formal
or informal meetings, dedicated websites, contractual agreements);
• how it identifies and removes potential barriers to the communication or dissemination of
the policy commitments (e.g., by making them accessible and available in relevant
languages).
38 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-24 Embedding policy commitments
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. describe how it embeds each of its policy commitments for responsible business
conduct throughout its activities and business relationships, including:
i. how it allocates responsibility to implement the commitments across different
levels within the organization;
ii. how it integrates the commitments into organizational strategies, operational
policies, and operational procedures;
iii. how it implements its commitments with and through its business relationships;
iv. training that the organization provides on implementing the commitments.
This disclosure gives insight into how the organization embeds its policy commitments for
GUIDANCE
responsible business conduct, including the commitment to respect human rights, throughout
its activities and business relationships. This ensures that people at all levels act responsibly
and with awareness of and respect for human rights.
Guidance to 2-24-a-i
Examples of different levels within an organization include the highest governance body, senior
executives, and operational levels.
The organization can report:
• the most senior level with oversight of, or accountability for, the implementation of the policy
commitments;
• the functions in the organization with day-to-day responsibility for implementing each of the
policy commitments (e.g., human resources with the responsibility for implementing the
commitment to respect the rights of workers), including:
- their reporting lines to senior decision-making levels;
- the reason for allocating the responsibility to them;
• whether responsible business conduct is formally discussed at meetings of the highest
governance body or senior executives and, if so, which topics are discussed;
• whether there are other formal or systematic means for discussions about responsible
business conduct between different levels or functions in the organization (e.g., a cross-
functional working group).
Guidance to 2-24-a-ii
The organization can describe:
• how it aligns the policy commitments with its:
- broader risk management systems and management policies;
- economic, environmental, social, and human rights impact assessments, and other due
diligence processes;
- policies and procedures that set financial and other performance incentives for
management or workers;
• how it applies the policy commitments when making decisions, such as about its sourcing
and operating locations;
• the systems (e.g., internal audit) it uses to monitor compliance with the policy commitments
throughout its activities (across functions and geographic locations) and throughout its
business relationships.
Guidance to 2-24-a-iii
The organization can describe:
• its procurement or investment policies and practices, and its engagement with those with
which it has business relationships, including:
- whether and how it applies pre-qualification processes, bidding criteria, or screening
criteria consistent with the expectations stipulated in the policy commitments for
responsible business conduct;
- whether and how it considers the policy commitments in contracting or investment
agreements, or in specific policies or codes of conduct for suppliers;
• whether and how it considers the policy commitments in the process of determining whether
to initiate, continue, or terminate a business relationship;
39 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
• processes through which it enables or supports business partners and other parties to
implement the policy commitments (e.g., capacity building, peer sharing);
• incentives that it offers to business partners and other parties to implement the policy
commitments (e.g., price premiums, increased orders, long-term contracts).
Guidance to 2-24-a-iv
The organization can report:
• the content of the training;
• to whom the training is provided, and whether it is mandatory;
• the form (e.g., in-person, online) and frequency of the training;
• examples of how the organization has determined that the training is effective.
The organization can report whether the training covers how to implement the policy
commitments in general or in specific situations (e.g., ensuring the commitment to privacy when
handling customers’ personal data, ensuring the policy commitments are considered in
procurement practices).
The organization can specify if training is provided to those with day-to-day responsibility for and
those with oversight of or accountability for implementing the policy commitments. The
organization can also specify if training is provided to those with which it has business
relationships (e.g., distributors, franchisees, joint ventures, suppliers). The organization can
report the number or percentage of workers, business partners, and other parties that have
been trained during the reporting period.
40 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-25 Processes to remediate negative impacts
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. describe its commitments to provide for or cooperate in the remediation of
negative impacts that the organization identifies it has caused or contributed to;
b. describe its approach to identify and address grievances, including the grievance
mechanisms that the organization has established or participates in;
c. describe other processes by which the organization provides for or cooperates in the
remediation of negative impacts that it identifies it has caused or contributed to;
d. describe how the stakeholders who are the intended users of the grievance
mechanisms are involved in the design, review, operation, and improvement of these
mechanisms;
e. describe how the organization tracks the effectiveness of the grievance mechanisms
and other remediation processes, and report examples of their effectiveness, including
stakeholder feedback.
This disclosure covers grievance mechanisms that the organization has established or
GUIDANCE
participates in. Grievance mechanisms enable stakeholders to raise concerns about, and
seek remedy for, the organization’s potential and actual negative impacts on them. This
includes impacts on their human rights. This disclosure also covers other processes by which
the organization provides for or cooperates in the remediation of negative impacts that it
identifies it has caused or contributed to.
The United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights [14] and
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises [12] set out expectations for organizations to provide for or cooperate in
the remediation, through legitimate processes, of negative impacts that they identify they have
caused or contributed to. The organization is not responsible for the remediation of negative
impacts directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its business relationships,
where the organization has not contributed to the impacts. It can, however, play a role in the
remediation. See Box 3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for more information on causing,
contributing, or being directly linked to negative impacts.
These instruments also set out expectations for organizations to establish or participate in
effective operational-level grievance mechanisms.
Grievance mechanisms are distinct from whistleblowing mechanisms. Whistleblowing
mechanisms enable individuals to raise concerns about wrongdoing or breaches of the law in
the organization’s operations or business relationships, regardless of whether the individuals
themselves are harmed or not. Whistleblowing mechanisms are reported under Disclosure 2-
26 in this Standard.
This disclosure covers the operation of grievance mechanisms and other remediation
processes. The actions taken to provide for or cooperate in the remediation of actual negative
impacts for material topics are reported under 3-3-d-ii in GRI 3.
The disclosure is only relevant to environmental remediation processes (e.g., processes to
remove contaminants from soil) when these are connected to impacts on stakeholders or
grievances raised by stakeholders. However, the remedy provided to stakeholders through the
mechanisms and processes covered by this disclosure may involve environmental remediation.
The use of environmental remediation processes can be reported under 3-3-d-ii in GRI 3.
Guidance to 2-25-b
Grievance mechanisms refer to any routinized, state-based or non-state-based, judicial or non-
judicial processes through which stakeholders can raise grievances and seek remedy.
Examples of state-based judicial and non-judicial grievance mechanisms include courts (for
both criminal and civil actions), labor tribunals, national human rights institutions, National
Contact Points under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ombudsperson offices,
41 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
consumer protection agencies, regulatory oversight bodies, and government-run complaints
offices.
Non-state-based grievance mechanisms include those administered by the organization, either
alone or together with stakeholders, such as operational-level grievance mechanisms
and collective bargaining, including the mechanisms established by collective bargaining. They
also include mechanisms administered by industry associations, international organizations,
civil society organizations, or multi-stakeholder groups.
Operational-level grievance mechanisms are administered by the organization either alone or in
collaboration with other parties and are directly accessible by the organization’s stakeholders.
They allow for grievances to be identified and addressed early and directly, thereby preventing
both harm and grievances from escalating. They also provide important feedback on the
effectiveness of the organization’s due diligence from those who are directly affected.
The organization can describe:
• the intended purpose and users of the mechanisms (i.e., whether they are intended for a
particular stakeholder category, topic, or region) and whether they enable users to raise
human rights-related concerns. For example, the organization can explain that it has
established a mechanism for community members to raise complaints about resettlement,
as well as a separate hotline for workers to raise concerns about issues affecting their
rights, such as health and safety conditions;
• how the mechanisms operate and who administers them (the organization or another party);
• whether operational-level grievance mechanisms are administered at the organizational
level or whether they are administered at a lower level (at the site or project level) and, in
such a case, how information from these mechanisms is centralized;
• how the mechanisms have been designed and on which principles and guidelines they are
based, including whether they are designed to meet the effectiveness criteria set out in UN
Guiding Principle 31 [14];
• the process through which grievances are investigated;
• whether grievances are communicated to the highest governance body;
• whether grievances are treated confidentially;
• whether the mechanisms can be used by stakeholders anonymously through representation
by a third party;
• whether the organization requires or provides incentives for the creation or improvement of
operational-level grievance mechanisms in workplaces of suppliers;
• whether the organization provides a back-up process for workplaces of suppliers that do not
have operational-level grievance mechanisms or where the existing grievance mechanisms
in those workplaces result in unresolved issues.
Guidance to 2-25-c
Requirement 2-25-c covers remediation processes other than grievance mechanisms. Such
processes lead to the remediation of an impact without mechanisms for filing a formal
complaint.
Examples include instances where the organization takes action to remediate an actual impact
evidenced in an impact assessment or a report published by a civil society organization.
Guidance to 2-25-d
The organization can describe, for example, how it engages with stakeholders who are the
intended users of the grievance mechanisms, to understand how they want to access the
mechanisms to raise concerns, and their expectations about how the mechanisms will operate.
Guidance to 2-25-e
According to UN Guiding Principle 31 [14], effective grievance mechanisms are legitimate,
accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, and a source of continuous
learning. In addition to these criteria, effective operational-level grievance mechanisms are also
based on engagement and dialogue. It can be more difficult for the organization to assess the
effectiveness of grievance mechanisms that it participates in compared to those it has
established itself.
The organization can report:
42 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
• whether and how the intended users are informed about the grievance mechanisms and
remediation processes;
• whether and how the intended users are trained to use the grievance mechanisms and
remediation processes;
• the accessibility of the grievance mechanisms and remediation processes, such as the
number of hours per day or days per week they are accessible, and their availability in
different languages;
• how the organization seeks to ensure it respects users’ human rights and protects them
against reprisals (i.e., non-retaliation for raising complaints or concerns);
• how satisfied users are with the grievance mechanisms and remediation processes, and
with the resulting outcomes, as well as how the organization assesses user satisfaction;
• the number and types of grievances filed during the reporting period, and the percentage of
grievances that were addressed and resolved, including the percentage that were resolved
through remediation;
• the number of grievances filed during the reporting period that are repeated or recurring;
• changes made to the grievance mechanisms and remediation processes in response to
lessons learned about their effectiveness.
Quantitative data, such as the number of grievances, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For
example, a low number of grievances could indicate that few incidents have occurred, but it
could also signal that their intended users do not trust the mechanisms. For this reason,
contextual information should be provided to help information users interpret the data.
43 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-26 Mechanisms for seeking advice and raising
concerns
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. describe the mechanisms for individuals to:
i. seek advice on implementing the organization’s policies and practices for
responsible business conduct;
ii. raise concerns about the organization’s business conduct.
This disclosure covers the organization’s mechanisms for individuals to seek advice and raise
GUIDANCE
concerns about responsible business conduct in the organization's operations and business
relationships. Examples of these mechanisms include confidential interviews during site visits,
escalation processes (to raise issues through management levels), hotlines, mechanisms to
report non-compliance with laws and regulations, and whistleblowing mechanisms.
These mechanisms enable individuals to raise concerns about wrongdoing or breaches of the
law in the organization’s operations or business relationships, regardless of whether the
individuals themselves are harmed or not. They are distinct from grievance mechanisms, which
enable stakeholders to raise concerns about, and seek remedy / remediation for, the
organization’s potential and actual negative impacts on them. Grievance mechanisms are
reported under Disclosure 2-25 in this Standard.
If the organization’s grievance mechanisms and its mechanisms for seeking advice and raising
concerns about responsible business conduct operate in a similar way, the organization can
provide a single description of how these mechanisms operate and explain which mechanisms
the description covers.
The organization can report:
• who the intended users of the mechanisms are;
• how the mechanisms operate and which level or function in the organization is assigned
responsibility for them;
• whether the mechanisms are operated independently of the organization (e.g., by a third
party);
• the process through which concerns are investigated;
• whether requests for advice and concerns raised are treated confidentially;
• whether the mechanisms can be used anonymously.
Additionally, the organization can report information about the effectiveness of the mechanisms,
including:
• whether and how the intended users are informed about the mechanisms and trained on
how to use them;
• the accessibility of the mechanisms, such as the number of hours per day or days per week
they are available, and their availability in different languages;
• how the organization seeks to ensure it respects users’ human rights and protects them
against reprisals (i.e., non-retaliation for raising concerns);
• how satisfied users are with the mechanisms and with the resulting outcomes;
• the number and types of requests for advice received during the reporting period, and the
percentage of requests that were answered;
• the number and types of concerns raised during the reporting period, and the percentage of
concerns that were addressed and resolved or found to be unsubstantiated.
44 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-27 Compliance with laws and regulations
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report the total number of significant instances of non-compliance with laws and
regulations during the reporting period, and a breakdown of this total by:
i. instances for which fines were incurred;
ii. instances for which non-monetary sanctions were incurred;
b. report the total number and the monetary value of fines for instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations that were paid during the reporting period, and a
breakdown of this total by:
i. fines for instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that occurred in
the current reporting period;
ii. fines for instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that occurred in
previous reporting periods;
c. describe the significant instances of non-compliance;
d. describe how it has determined significant instances of non-compliance.
This disclosure addresses non-compliance, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations that
GUIDANCE
apply to the organization.
Non-compliance with laws and regulations can give insight into the ability of management to
ensure that the organization conforms to certain performance parameters.
Laws and regulations can be issued by various bodies, including local, regional, and national
governments; regulatory authorities; and public agencies.
Laws and regulations include:
• international declarations, conventions, and treaties;
• national, subnational, regional, and local regulations;
• binding voluntary agreements made with regulatory authorities and developed as a
substitute for implementing a new regulation;
• voluntary agreements (or covenants), if the organization directly joins the agreement, or if
public agencies make the agreement applicable to organizations in their territory through
legislation or regulation.
This disclosure includes significant instances of non-compliance that resulted in administrative
or judicial sanctions and fines that are being appealed during the reporting period.
Non-monetary sanctions can include restrictions imposed by governments, regulatory
authorities, or public agencies on the organization’s activities or operations, such as withdrawal
of trading licenses or licenses to operate in highly regulated industries. They can also include
directives to cease or remediate an unlawful activity.
The organization can use information about fines that have been reported in its audited
consolidated financial statements or in the financial information filed on public record, including
fines that are being appealed and which may appear as balance sheet reserves in the financial
statements.
If there were no significant instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations or no fines
were paid during the reporting period, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the
disclosure.
Guidance to 2-27-c
The description of significant instances of non-compliance can include the geographic location
where the instance occurred, and the matter to which the instance relates, such as a tax fraud or
a spill. The organization is required to report sufficient information for information users to
understand the type and the context of significant instances of non-compliance.
The organization can also explain whether the significant instances are repeated or recurring.
45 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Guidance to 2-27-d
When determining the significant instances of non-compliance, the organization can assess:
• the severity of the impact resulting from the instance;
• external benchmarks used in its sector to determine significant instances of non-
compliance.
46 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-28 Membership associations
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report industry associations, other membership associations, and national or
international advocacy organizations in which it participates in a significant role.
The organization may have a significant role in an association or advocacy organization when it
GUIDANCE
holds a position in the governance body, participates in projects or committees, or provides
substantive funding beyond routine membership dues. The role may also be significant when
the organization views its membership as strategic to influencing the mission or objective of the
association that is critical to the organization’s own activities.
47 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
5. Stakeholder engagement
The disclosures in this section provide information about the organization’s stakeholder engagement practices,
including how it engages in collective bargaining with employees.
Disclosure 2-29 Approach to stakeholder engagement
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. describe its approach to engaging with stakeholders, including:
i. the categories of stakeholders it engages with, and how they are identified;
ii. the purpose of the stakeholder engagement;
iii. how the organization seeks to ensure meaningful engagement with stakeholders.
Stakeholders are individuals or groups that have interests that are affected or could be affected
GUIDANCE
by the organization’s activities [11]. For more information on stakeholders, see section 2.4
in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
This disclosure covers stakeholder engagement undertaken by the organization as part of its
ongoing activities, rather than specifically for the purpose of sustainability reporting.
Guidance to 2-29-a-i
Common categories of stakeholders for organizations are business partners, civil society
organizations, consumers, customers, employees and other workers, governments, local
communities, non-governmental organizations, shareholders and other investors, suppliers,
trade unions, and vulnerable groups.
The organization can explain how it determines which categories of stakeholders to engage with
and which categories not to engage with.
Guidance to 2-29-a-ii
The purpose of stakeholder engagement can be, for example, to identify actual and
potential impacts or to determine prevention and mitigation responses to potential negative
impacts. In some cases, stakeholder engagement is a right in and of itself, such as the right of
workers to form or join trade unions or their right to bargain collectively.
The organization can also report:
• the type of stakeholder engagement (e.g., participation, consultation, information) and its
frequency (e.g., ongoing, quarterly, annually);
• when it engages directly with stakeholders and when it engages with credible stakeholder
representatives or proxy organizations, or other credible independent expert resources, and
why;
• whether stakeholder engagement activities take place at the organizational level or at a lower
level, such as at the site or project level, and in the latter case, how information from
stakeholder engagement activities is centralized;
• the resources (e.g., financial or human resources) allocated to stakeholder engagement.
Further information on stakeholder engagement undertaken for specific activities is reported
under other disclosures. For example, the organization must report on stakeholder engagement
undertaken to determine and manage material topics under 3-1-b and 3-3-f in GRI 3: Material
Topics 2021.
Guidance to 2-29-a-iii
Meaningful stakeholder engagement is characterized by two-way communication and depends
on the good faith of participants on both sides. It is also responsive and ongoing and includes in
many cases engaging with relevant stakeholders before decisions are made. [11]
The organization can report:
• how it takes into account potential barriers to stakeholder engagement (e.g., language and
cultural differences, gender and power imbalances, divisions within a community or group);
48 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
• how it engages with at-risk or vulnerable groups (e.g., whether it takes specific approaches
and gives special attention to potential barriers);
• how it provides stakeholders with information that is understandable and accessible through
appropriate communication channels;
• how stakeholder feedback is recorded and integrated into decision-making, and how
stakeholders are informed about the way in which their feedback has influenced decisions;
• how it seeks to respect the human rights of all stakeholders engaged, for example, their
rights to privacy, freedom of expression, and peaceful assembly and protest;
• how it works with business partners to engage with stakeholders in a meaningful way,
including the expectations it places on business partners to respect the human rights of
stakeholders during engagement.
49 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
Disclosure 2-30 Collective bargaining agreements
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report the percentage of total employees covered by collective bargaining agreements;
b. for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements, report whether the
organization determines their working conditions and terms of employment based on
collective bargaining agreements that cover its other employees or based on collective
bargaining agreements from other organizations.
This disclosure provides insights into how the organization engages in collective bargaining
GUIDANCE
with its employees. Collective bargaining is a fundamental right at work covered in the
International Labour Organization (ILO) Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining
Convention [8].
Collective bargaining refers to negotiations that take place between one or more employers or
employers' organizations and one or more workers' organizations (e.g., trade unions). The
objective of these negotiations is to reach a collective agreement on working conditions and
terms of employment (e.g., wages, working time) and to regulate relations between employers
and workers. [3] These negotiations are an important means through which employers’
organizations and workers’ organizations can improve working conditions and labor relations.
Collective agreements can be made at the level of the organization, at the level of a particular
site, at the industry level, and at the national level in countries where this is the practice.
Collective agreements can cover specific groups of workers, for example, those performing a
specific activity or working at a specific location.
If the organization has a statement or policy commitment on freedom of association and
collective bargaining, this is reported under 2-23-b-i in this Standard or 3-3-c in GRI 3: Material
Topics 2021.
See references [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8], [10], [21], [25], and [26] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 2-30-a
The organization is required to report the percentage of its employees whose working
conditions and terms of employment are regulated by one or more collective bargaining
agreements.
The percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements is calculated using
the following formula:
Number of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements
___________________________________________________
x 100
Total number of employees reported under 2-7-a
The employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are those employees to whom the
organization is obligated to apply the agreement. This means that if none of the employees are
covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the percentage reported is zero. An employee
covered by more than one collective bargaining agreement only needs to be counted once.
This requirement does not ask for the percentage of employees represented by a works council
or belonging to trade unions, which can be different. The percentage of employees covered by
collective bargaining agreements can be higher than the percentage of unionized employees
when the collective bargaining agreements apply to both union and non-union members.
Alternatively, the percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can be
lower than the percentage of unionized employees. This may be the case when there are no
collective bargaining agreements available or when the collective bargaining agreements do not
cover all unionized employees.
50 GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021
The organization can also provide a breakdown of the percentage of employees covered by
collective bargaining agreements by region, or provide comparisons with industry benchmarks.
Guidance to 2-30-b
There may be instances where collective bargaining agreements cover some or none of the
organization’s employees. However, the working conditions and terms of employment of these
employees may be influenced or determined by the organization based on other collective
bargaining agreements, such as agreements that cover other employees or agreements from
other organizations. If this is the case, the organization is required to report it under 2-30-b. If this
is not the case, and the working conditions and terms of employment of these employees are
not influenced or determined based on other collective bargaining agreements, a brief
statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with this requirement.
