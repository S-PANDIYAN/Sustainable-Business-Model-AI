Introduction
GRI 103: Energy 2025 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their energy-related impacts,
and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains one disclosure, which provides information about how the organization manages its energy-
related impacts.
• Section 2 contains four disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s energy-related impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing
this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards,
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of energy.
The use of energy leads to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change.
Most countries worldwide have committed to combating climate change, as outlined in the Paris Agreement [2].
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [1], global warming should be limited to 1.5ºC
above pre-industrial levels. This is not possible without rapid and deep reductions in energy system GHG emissions
by 2050. Organizations will, therefore, be required to make significant changes in how they consume energy,
including transitioning to renewable energy, electrifying end-use sectors, and phasing out fossil fuels.
Organizations consume energy in various forms, such as fuel, electricity, heating, cooling, or steam. Energy can be
self-generated or purchased from third parties and come from renewable or non-renewable sources. Energy
consumption also occurs throughout activities upstream and downstream of organizations’ operations. This can
include consumers’ use and the end-of-life treatment of organizations’ products.
Energy consumption and the transition to renewable energy can have negative or positive impacts on the environment
and people, including their human rights. As such, measures are required across the value chain that support
workers, local communities, and other stakeholders, and ensure the protection of the environment.
Negative environmental impacts can include climate change, driven by GHG emissions from energy consumption,
biodiversity loss due to energy infrastructure affecting soil and other natural resources, and pollution from waste, such
as exhausted batteries. Negative impacts on people can occur throughout the value chain and include job losses and
limited access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy. Positive impacts include improving quality of life
through energy access and enhancing employment opportunities through training and reskilling workers.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
5 GRI 103: Energy 2025
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its energy-related impacts. In addition to this Standard, disclosures that
relate to this topic can be found in GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024 and GRI 102: Climate Change 2025.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined energy to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s energy-related impacts
(Disclosure 103-1 through Disclosure 103-5).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
6 GRI 103: Energy 2025
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
1. Topic management disclosures
7 GRI 103: Energy 2025
1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of
its material topics.
An organization that has determined energy to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic
using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021. The organization is also required to report any disclosure from
this section (Disclosure 103-1) that is relevant to its energy-related impacts.
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
Disclosure 103-1 Energy policies and commitments
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. describe how its energy-related policies and commitments contribute to energy
consumption reduction, energy efficiency, and the transition to renewable energy
sources;
b. describe the impacts on the economy, environment, and people that may result from its
energy consumption and the transition to renewable energy sources.
Guidance to 103-1-a
GUIDANCE
This requirement covers policies and commitments that apply to the organization’s activities and
its upstream and downstream value chain.
Examples of energy-related policies that contribute to energy efficiency and the transition to
renewable energy sources include policies on:
• energy efficiency (e.g., promoting energy-saving practices in the workplace);
• the use of renewable energy, including purchasing contractual instruments (e.g., energy
attribute certificates [EACs], renewable electricity certificates [RECs], power purchase
agreements, and green electricity products);
• suppliers’ use of renewable energy;
• just transition (e.g., training workers on land rights).
The organization should explain how its energy-related policies and commitments relate to
applicable country, regional, or industry-level energy regulations.
In addition, the organization should report whether and how its energy-related policies and
commitments are in line with the latest scientific evidence on the effort needed to limit global
warming to 1.5°C.
The organization should report its short-, medium-, and long-term targets aimed at:
• reducing energy consumption;
• increasing energy efficiency; and
• transitioning to renewable energy sources, including whether and how contractual
instruments are taken into account in renewable energy target setting and monitoring.
The organization should also describe how engagement with stakeholders informs its energy-
related policies and commitments, including:
• how it identifies stakeholders, including whether it has performed a social impact
assessment, whose human rights, health, socio-economic well-being, or other interests
could be affected, including at-risk or vulnerable groups;
• how it engages with identified stakeholders, credible stakeholder representatives, or proxy
organizations to understand their concerns and interests;
• how insights from stakeholder engagement, including from workers, trade unions, worker
representatives, suppliers, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and governments, have
informed actions to prevent or mitigate negative impacts and maximize positive impacts.
8 GRI 103: Energy 2025
Disclosure 2-29 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 covers the organization’s approach to
engaging with its stakeholders. If the organization has described how engagement with its
stakeholders has informed the development and implementation of its energy-related policies
and commitments under Disclosure 2-29, it can provide a reference to this information.
The organization should report any investments allocated for energy consumption reduction,
energy efficiency (e.g., heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning improvements), and the
transition to renewable energy sources (e.g., investment in energy transition technologies,
renewable energy, and redesign of products, processes, or services).
Guidance to 103-1-b
This requirement enables the organization to describe the impacts on the economy,
environment, and people that may result from its energy consumption and the transition to
renewable energy sources across its activities and business relationships. These impacts can
be the result of energy generation.
In the case of self-generation, the impacts are the result of an organization’s activities. In the
case of purchased energy, the impacts are the result of an organization’s business
relationships with suppliers (e.g., energy providers).
Impacts on people include those on workers, local communities, and vulnerable groups, such
as Indigenous Peoples. Positive impacts on people can include improving quality of life through
providing heat, light, and mobility, recruiting workers, or creating skills by training workers to
support the transition to renewable energy consumption. Negative impacts can include job loss
from the shift to renewable energy, health and safety risks from air pollution caused by burning
fossil fuels, and land rights violations during land acquisition for energy generation.
Impacts on the environment can include those on biodiversity and pollution. Positive impacts
can include energy-related infrastructure, such as offshore wind farms, acting as refuges for fish
and marine mammals. Negative impacts of energy-related infrastructure development can
include damage to species’ habitats due to land and sea use changes and pollution – including
dust, waste, noise, and light – from construction, decommissioning, and repowering of
infrastructure, such as solar plants.
For further information on impacts on biodiversity, see reference [3] in the Bibliography.
The organization should describe actions taken to manage impacts that may result from its
energy consumption and the transition to renewable energy sources.
Examples of actions taken by the organization to manage impacts that are a result of energy
generation include:
• using or increasing the organization’s leverage by enforcing contractual requirements on
energy supply;
• implementing incentives such as future orders;
• active collaboration with other actors to motivate the energy provider to prevent or mitigate
potential negative impacts.
Examples of actions to manage impacts on biodiversity include:
• careful project siting and planning and using already converted or disturbed land;
• implementing measures on wind farms to reduce the risk of turbine blade collisions, such
as using acoustic deterrents for birds and increasing wind turbine visibility.
The organization can use Disclosure 101-2 in GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024 to report the actions
taken to manage its impacts on biodiversity.
2. Topic disclosures
9 GRI 103: Energy 2025
2. Topic disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report any disclosures from this section
(Disclosure 103-2 through Disclosure 103-5) that are relevant to its energy-related impacts.
Disclosure 103-2 Energy consumption and self-generation within
the organization
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report total fuel consumption within the organization in joules, watt-hours, or multiples,
and a breakdown of this total by:
i. renewable and non-renewable energy sources;
ii. each activity in which the fuel is consumed for each renewable and non-renewable
energy source;
b. report total purchased electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumption within the
organization in joules, watt-hours, or multiples, and a breakdown of this total by:
i. renewable and non-renewable energy sources;
ii. electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumption for each renewable and non-
renewable energy source;
c. report total self-generated renewable electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumption
within the organization in joules, watt-hours, or multiples, and a breakdown of this total by
electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumption for each activity in which it is
consumed for each renewable energy source;
d. report total self-generated electricity, heating, cooling, and steam sold in joules, watt-
hours, or multiples, and a breakdown of this total by:
i. renewable and non-renewable energy sources;
ii. electricity, heating, cooling, and steam sold for each renewable and non-
renewable energy source;
e. report whether contractual instruments are used to disclose information on purchased
electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumption, and if so, describe how the
contractual instruments adhere to quality criteria to ensure accuracy and consistency;
f. report standards, methodologies, assumptions, and calculation tools used, including the
source of the conversion factors used.
Throughout this guidance, electricity, heating, cooling, and steam are collectively referred to as
GUIDANCE
‘electricity’ in alignment with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance [5]. In other frameworks,
‘electricity’ can be referred to as ‘non-fuel’.
An organization can consume energy in the form of fuel (103-2-a) or electricity, whereby an
organization separately reports energy consumption from electricity purchased (103-2-b) and
electricity self-generated from renewable sources (103-2-c).
Energy can be purchased from third parties or produced by the organization (self-generated).
Energy can come from renewable or non-renewable sources.
For an example of how to present information on requirements in Disclosure 103-2, see Table
1 and Table 2.
The organization can report the total energy consumption within the organization as the sum of
103-2-a, 103-2-b, and 103-2-c. The organization can also report the total net energy
consumption by subtracting the electricity sold (103-2-d) from the total energy consumption
within the organization (103-2-a + 103-2-b + 103-2-c).
10 GRI 103: Energy 2025
Organizations can also store or purchase energy through specific energy carriers (e.g.,
hydrogen) and energy storage systems (e.g., batteries). When the organization consumes
energy from energy carriers or storage systems, this consumption is reported under 103-2-a,
103-2-b, or 103-2-c. If the organization sells electricity from energy carriers or storage systems,
this is reported under 103-2-d. When the organization consumes or sells energy from energy
carriers or storage systems, it reports the information required in this disclosure as per their
primary energy source. For example, if a carrier’s primary energy source is natural gas and the
carrier is consumed as fuel, energy consumption from the carrier will be reported as fuel
consumption from non-renewable sources. The organization should report any contextual
information on the energy carriers’ primary energy source, for example, governmental programs
(e.g., subsidies for hydrogen production) that supported its production or associated contractual
instruments.
Where it aids transparency or comparability over time, the organization can provide a breakdown
of the energy consumption by, for example:
• business unit or facility;
• country.
Guidance to 103-2-a
This requirement covers fuel consumption from fuels purchased by the organization and fuels
self-generated, such as coal mined, oil and gas extracted, or biofuel produced. The organization
can report the consumption of fuel purchased and fuel self-generated separately.
Fuel consumption from non-renewable energy sources usually contributes to the
organization’s Scope 1 GHG emissions, which are reported under Disclosure 102-5 in GRI
102: Climate Change 2025.
Self-generated electricity consumption from fuel is counted under fuel consumption (103-2-a).
For example, if an organization has a co-generator that burns non-renewable fuels to produce
electricity and then consumes the generated electricity, this is counted once under fuel
consumption.
Guidance to 103-2-a-i
Fuel consumption from renewable sources can include biofuels purchased or self-generated
from biomass owned or controlled by the organization (also comprising industrial waste of
biological origin).
Fuel consumption from non-renewable sources can include gasoline and liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG) used for combustion in boilers, furnaces, heaters, turbines, flares, incinerators,
generators, and vehicles owned or controlled by the organization.
Guidance to 103-2-a-ii
This requirement aims to identify the main drivers of fuel consumption within the organization.
To comply with this requirement, the organization can, for example, report a breakdown of the
top five fuel-consuming activities and combine the remaining activities into an ‘other’ category.
Examples of activities where fuel is consumed include manufacturing processes, operating
office equipment, operating a car fleet, heating buildings, and conducting research and
development.
Guidance to 103-2-b, 103-2-c, and 103-2-d
In line with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance [5], definitions of electricity, heating, cooling,
and steam can include:
• Electricity used for operating machines, lighting, electric vehicle charging, or heating and
cooling systems.
• Heating commercial or industrial buildings to control interior climates and heat water. Many
industrial processes also require heat for specific equipment.
• Cooling produced through the distribution of cooled air or water.
• Steam used for mechanical work, heat, or directly as a process medium.
Electricity consumption from renewable sources can include wind and solar. Electricity
consumption from non-renewable sources can include coal, oil, and natural gas.
11 GRI 103: Energy 2025
Guidance to 103-2-b
This requirement covers purchased electricity consumption from renewable and non-renewable
energy sources.
In this requirement, consumption of purchased electricity also refers to circumstances where
the organization indirectly acquires and consumes electricity (e.g., as a tenant of a property).
Contractual instruments can provide information on the breakdown of purchased electricity by
renewable and non-renewable sources under 103-2-b-i. Examples of contractual instruments
include energy attribute certificates (EACs), renewable electricity certificates (RECs), power
purchase agreements, and green electricity products. This can be helpful when variations in
accounting methods across countries make it difficult to report this breakdown consistently.
The organization should report whether the consumption of purchased electricity from
renewable sources was calculated based on grid-average data (location-based data) or
contractual instruments (market-based data). The organization should report how it purchases
electricity from the grid (e.g., from a utility, retail service provider, or wholesale procurements). In
addition, the organization should report the percentage of energy sources in the grid mix in
which they are purchasing electricity, for example, 50% from wind and 50% from natural gas. If
applicable, the organization should report which types of contractual instruments it uses (e.g.,
power purchase agreements, utility green tariffs, or unbundled certificates) and the amount and
percentage of the total purchased electricity covered by each instrument.
Based on the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance [5], quality criteria apply to all contractual
instruments to ensure accuracy and consistency of reporting (see Guidance to 102-6-a for
further information).
The organization can report additional information on the contractual instruments, for example:
• the date that a renewable generation facility was commissioned or repowered;
• whether a renewable generation facility receives government subsidies or other support;
• the length of the contract for contractual instruments;
• whether the contract was signed before the investment decision to build a renewable
generation facility.
Consumption of purchased electricity contributes to the organization’s Scope 2 GHG emissions,
which are reported under Disclosure 102-6 in GRI 102: Climate Change 2025.
Guidance to 103-2-c
This requirement covers self-generated electricity consumption from renewable energy sources
(e.g., wind, solar).
When the organization generates electricity from fuel consumed and then uses the generated
electricity, the energy consumption is counted once under 103-2-a.
Self-generated renewable electricity consumption does not include electricity whose
contractual instruments have been sold off.
The required breakdown by activity aims to identify the main drivers of electricity consumption
within the organization. To comply with this requirement, the organization can, for example,
report a breakdown of the top five electricity-consuming activities and combine the remaining
activities into an ‘other’ category.
Examples of activities where electricity is consumed include manufacturing processes,
operating office equipment, operating a car fleet, heating buildings, and conducting research
and development.
Guidance to 103-2-d
When the organization sells self-generated renewable electricity, it should report whether it
has sold off any linked contractual instruments. The organization should also report a
breakdown of self-generated renewable electricity sold with:
• contractual instruments; or
• attributes retained.
12 GRI 103: Energy 2025
Table 2 offers an example of how to present information on self-generated electricity sold. The
organization can amend the table according to its practices.
Guidance to 103-2-e
The following quality criteria, built on the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance [5], apply to
contractual instruments (e.g., EACs):
• Contractual instruments must convey the GHG emission rate attribute associated with the
electricity produced. Attributes are defined as descriptive or performance characteristics of a
particular generation resource. Each contractual instrument must be the only source of a
GHG emission rate attribute claim associated with its quantity of energy generation.
• Contractual instruments must be tracked and redeemed, retired, or canceled by or on behalf
of the reporting organization.
• Contractual instruments must be issued and redeemed as close as possible to the energy
consumption period the contractual instrument applies to.
• Contractual instruments must be sourced from the same market to which the contractual
instrument is applied.
The organization should also describe how it strives for the temporal and physical
connection between contractual instruments and their associated energy consumption.
For example, the contractual instrument can be sourced from the same grid or country
where it is applied, and the contractual instrument can be issued with hourly matching.
If the organization uses data from contractual instruments (e.g., EACs) to report self-
generated electricity sold, it should report how it ensures that contractual instruments
adhere to applicable quality criteria.
For further information on the quality criteria and how to support accurate accounting if an
organization cannot meet them, see reference [5] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 103-2-f
The organization should explain why the standards, methodologies, assumptions, and
calculation tools used were chosen.
The organization should:
• apply conversion factors consistently for all data disclosed;
• use conversion factors that best represent the specific energy content of the fuel to convert to
joules, watt-hours, or multiples. For example, the organization should use conversion factors
for bituminous coal instead of generic coal when reporting energy consumption from
bituminous coal.
Table 1 offers an example of how to present information on energy consumption within the
organization. The organization can amend the table according to its practices.
13 GRI 103: Energy 2025
Disclosure 103-3 Upstream and downstream energy consumption
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report total significant energy consumption in its upstream and downstream value
chain in joules, watt-hours, or multiples, and list the upstream and downstream
categories in which significant energy consumption occurs;
b. report standards, methodologies, assumptions, and calculation tools used, including
the source of the conversion factors used.
This disclosure covers energy consumption from activities outside the organization and
GUIDANCE
includes the upstream and downstream value chain.
Consumption of non-renewable energy sources upstream and downstream in the
organization’s value chain contributes to the organization’s Scope 3 GHG emissions, which are
reported under Disclosure 102-7 in GRI 102: Climate Change 2025.
Guidance to 103-3-a
To compile the information required under 103-3-a, the organization can use the following
steps:
• Identify which activities in its upstream and downstream value chain have significant energy
consumption.
• Add up the energy consumption for these activities.
• Attribute the activities that have significant energy consumption to the upstream and
downstream categories listed below.
• List the upstream and downstream categories.
The organization should provide a breakdown of the total significant energy consumption in its
upstream and downstream value chain by upstream and downstream categories in which
significant energy consumption occurs. To compile this information, the organization can use
the following steps:
• Refer to the list of upstream and downstream categories in which significant energy
consumption occurs.
• For each category, report the energy consumption.
The organization can identify which activities in its upstream and downstream value chain have
significant energy consumption by assessing whether an activity’s energy consumption:
• contributes significantly to the organization’s total energy consumption in its upstream and
downstream value chain;
• offers potential for reductions the organization can undertake or influence;
• contributes to climate change as high-emitting activity;
• is deemed material by stakeholders, such as civil society organizations, customers,
investors, or suppliers;
• results from outsourcing a previously performed in-house activity or that is typically
performed in-house by other organizations in the same sector;
• has been identified as significant for the organization’s sector;
• meets additional criteria for determining relevance developed by the organization or its
sector.
The significant energy consumption in the organization’s upstream and downstream value
chain includes the significant energy consumption for each of the following upstream and
downstream categories from the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting
and Reporting Standard [4]:
Upstream categories
1. Purchased goods and services
2. Capital goods
3. Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Disclosure 103-2)
4. Upstream transportation and distribution
5. Waste generated in operations
14 GRI 103: Energy 2025
6. Business travel
7. Employee commuting
8. Upstream leased assets
Downstream categories
9. Downstream transportation and distribution
10. Processing of sold products
11. Use of sold products
12. End-of-life treatment of sold products
13. Downstream leased assets
14. Franchises
15. Investments
The organization should use all reasonable and supportable information at the reporting date to
measure upstream and downstream energy consumption.
The organization should report upstream and downstream energy consumption separately for
renewable and non-renewable energy sources.
If the organization cannot use primary data to calculate significant upstream and downstream
energy consumption, it can estimate the consumption. Primary data is obtained from suppliers
or other value chain entities related to the organization’s activities. The organization should
report for which upstream and downstream categories estimations are used and the
percentage of data estimated for each category.
Guidance to 103-3-b
The organization should explain why the standards, methodologies, assumptions, and
calculation tools used were chosen.
The organization should:
• apply conversion factors consistently for all data disclosed;
• use conversion factors that best represent the specific energy content of the fuel to convert to
joules, watt-hours, or multiples. For example, when reporting on energy consumption from
bituminous coal, the organization should use conversion factors for bituminous coal instead
of generic coal.
15 GRI 103: Energy 2025
Disclosure 103-4 Energy intensity
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report energy intensity ratio(s), including the energy consumption in joules, watt-hours,
or multiples (the numerator) and the organization-specific metric (the denominator)
chosen to calculate the ratio(s);
b. report whether the energy intensity ratio(s) include energy consumption within the
organization, in its upstream and downstream value chain, or both;
c. report the types of energy consumption included in the energy intensity ratio(s),
whether fuel, electricity, heating, cooling, or steam.
Energy intensity ratios are obtained by dividing the energy consumption (the numerator) by an
GUIDANCE
organization-specific metric (the denominator). Many organizations track environmental
performance with intensity ratio(s).
Energy intensity ratios express the amount of energy consumed per unit of activity, output, or any
other organization-specific metric.
Energy intensity ratios can help stakeholders and the organization understand energy efficiency
in relation to other organizations while supporting investment decisions for energy reduction and
efficiency.
The organization should use data on energy consumption reported under Disclosures 103-2
and 103-3 to calculate the energy intensity ratio(s).
The organization should select a consistent organizational boundary for the numerator and
denominator in the energy intensity ratio.
For an example of how to present information on requirements in Disclosure 103-4, see Table
3.
Guidance to 103-4-a
Examples of energy intensity ratios can include:
• [amount of] fuel consumption within the organization in MWh (numerator) per 100 full-time
equivalent employees (denominator);
• [amount of] electricity consumption within the organization and upstream and downstream in
the value chain in megajoules (numerator) per EUR 1 million revenue (denominator).
Types of organization-specific metrics (denominators) can include:
• units of product;
• production volume (such as metric tons, liters, or MWh);
• size (such as m2 floor space);
• number of full-time equivalent employees;
• monetary units (such as revenue or sales).
Relevant denominators differ between industries or business units within an organization.
Therefore, the organization should choose a denominator relevant to its industry and aligned
with current industry standards. For example, the energy intensity of building performance
according to a recognized standard or the energy intensity of a given process per the process’
output, such as crude refining or cement production. When using recognized industry standards
to calculate energy intensity ratio(s), the organization should report the industry standards
according to which it calculated the ratio(s) and provide details on the methodologies used and
assumptions made.
Where it aids transparency or comparability over time, the organization should provide a
breakdown of the energy intensity ratios by:
• business unit or facility;
• country;
• energy source;
16 GRI 103: Energy 2025
• type of activity;
• upstream and downstream category.
Guidance to 103-4-b
This requirement aims to report what the energy intensity ratio covers, allowing the organization
to select the scope of the energy consumption data.
17 GRI 103: Energy 2025
Disclosure 103-5 Reduction in energy consumption
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report the reduction in energy consumption achieved in joules, watt-hours, or multiples,
including whether and how it is due to:
i. reductions from the organization’s conservation and efficiency initiatives;
ii. other factors;
b. report the types of energy consumption included in the reduction, whether fuel,
electricity, heating, cooling, or steam;
c. report whether the reduction in energy consumption was achieved within the
organization, in its upstream and downstream value chain, or both, and list the
upstream and downstream categories in which reduction was achieved;
d. report whether the reduction in energy consumption is estimated, modeled, or sourced
from direct measurements and, if applicable, the estimations or modeling methods
used;
e. report the base year or baseline for calculating the reduction in energy consumption,
including:
i. the rationale for choosing it;
ii. energy consumption in the base year or baseline;
f. report standards, methodologies, assumptions, and calculation tools used.
Reductions in energy consumption can be related to target setting. For further information on
GUIDANCE
energy target reporting, see Guidance to 103-1-a.
Guidance to 103-5-a
The reduction in energy consumption can be calculated by comparing the energy consumption
in the reporting period to:
• energy consumption in the base year; or
• projected energy consumption in the absence of any reduction activity (baseline).
Energy conservation and efficiency initiatives can include:
• process redesign;
• conversion and retrofitting of equipment;
• fuel switching;
• changes in behavior.
Examples of other factors include reduced production capacity or outsourcing, changes in
organizational boundaries, and weather fluctuations that affect energy supply.
The organization should report the percentage of the reduction in energy consumption
compared to the energy consumption in the base year or baseline.
The organization can provide a breakdown of the reduction in energy consumption by individual
conservation and efficiency initiatives.
Guidance to 103-5-b
The organization can provide a breakdown of the reduction in energy consumption by energy
type: fuel, electricity, heating, cooling, and steam.
Guidance to 103-5-c
This requirement aims to report what the energy consumption reduction covers, allowing the
organization to select the scope of the energy consumption data included.
The reduction in energy consumption achieved in the organization’s upstream and
downstream value chain includes the reduction achieved for each of the following upstream
and downstream categories from the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3)
18 GRI 103: Energy 2025
Accounting and Reporting Standard [4]:
Upstream categories
1. Purchased goods and services
2. Capital goods
3. Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Disclosure 103-2)
4. Upstream transportation and distribution
5. Waste generated in operations
6. Business travel
7. Employee commuting
8. Upstream leased assets
Downstream categories
9. Downstream transportation and distribution
10. Processing of sold products
11. Use of sold products
12. End-of-life treatment of sold products
13. Downstream leased assets
14. Franchises
15. Investments
The organization should provide a breakdown of the reduction in energy consumption achieved
in the organization’s upstream and downstream value chain by upstream and downstream
categories in which the reduction was achieved.
The organization should consider the whole life cycle of their products and services when
assessing energy consumption reduction. This is particularly important for products and
services with high energy consumption during their use phase due to their potential to affect
energy demand, such as electronic equipment and vehicles.
If applicable, the organization can report reductions in energy requirements during the use
phase of products and services, for example, a product that consumes 10% less energy per
hour.
Guidance to 103-5-f
The organization should explain why the standards, methodologies, assumptions, and
calculation tools used were chosen.
The organization should describe any changes in standards, methodologies, assumptions, and
calculation tools used compared to the previous reporting period(s), including the updates of the
energy consumption models developed to keep up with technological improvements.
