Introduction
GRI 416: Customer Health and Safety 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their
impacts related to customer health and safety, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts
related to customer health and safety.
• Section 2 contains two disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s impacts related to
customer health and safety.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of customer health and safety, including an organization’s systematic efforts to
address health and safety across the life cycle of a product or service, and its adherence to customer health and
safety regulations and voluntary codes.
These concepts are covered in key instruments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development:
see the Bibliography.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its impacts related to customer health and safety. In addition to this Standard,
disclosures that relate to this topic can be found in GRI 417: Marketing and Labeling 2016.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined customer health and safety to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s impacts related to customer health
and safety (Disclosure 416-1 through Disclosure 416-2).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).

Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.

1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined customer health and safety to be a material topic is required to report how it
manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages customer health and safety
REQUIREMENTS
using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
The reporting organization can also disclose whether the health and safety impacts of products
GUIDANCE
and services are assessed for improvement in each of the following life cycle stages:
• Development of product concept
• Research and development
• Certification
• Manufacturing and production
• Marketing and promotion
• Storage, distribution, and supply
• Use and service
• Disposal, reuse, or recycling

Disclosure 416-1 Assessment of the health and safety impacts of
product and service categories
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Percentage of significant product and service categories for which health and safety
impacts are assessed for improvement.
Guidance for Disclosure 416-1
GUIDANCE
This measure helps to identify the existence and range of systematic efforts to address health
and safety across the life cycle of a product or service. In reporting the information in Disclosure
416-1, the reporting organization can also describe the criteria used for the assessment.
9 GRI 416: Customer Health and Safety 2016
Disclosure 416-2 Incidents of non-compliance concerning the health
and safety impacts of products and services
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Total number of incidents of non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes
concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services within the reporting
period, by:
i. incidents of non-compliance with regulations resulting in a fine or penalty;
ii. incidents of non-compliance with regulations resulting in a warning;
iii. incidents of non-compliance with voluntary codes.
b. If the organization has not identified any non-compliance with regulations and/or
voluntary codes, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient.
Compilation requirements
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 416-2, the reporting
organization shall:
2.1.1 exclude incidents of non-compliance in which the organization was
determined not to be at fault;
2.1.2 exclude incidents of non-compliance related to Incidents related to labeling
are reported in Disclosure 417-2 of GRI 417: Marketing and Labelling 2016;
2.1.3 if applicable, identify any incidents of non-compliance that relate to events in
periods prior to the reporting period.
Guidance for Disclosure 416-2
GUIDANCE
The incidents of non-compliance that occur within the reporting period can relate to incidents
formally resolved during the reporting period, whether they occurred in periods prior to the
reporting period or not.
Background
Protection of health and safety is a recognized goal of many national and international
regulations. Customers expect products and services to perform their intended functions
satisfactorily, and not pose a risk to health and safety. Customers have a right to non-hazardous
products. Where their health and safety is affected, customers also have the right to seek
redress.
This disclosure addresses the life cycle of the product or service once it is available for use, and
therefore subject to regulations and voluntary codes concerning the health and safety of
products and services.
