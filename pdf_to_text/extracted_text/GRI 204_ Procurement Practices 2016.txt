Introduction
GRI 204: Procurement Practices 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their
procurement practice-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its
procurement practice-related impacts.
• Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s procurement practice-
related impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of procurement practices. This covers an organization’s support for local suppliers
or those owned by women or members of vulnerable groups. It also covers how the organization’s procurement
practices (such as the lead times it gives to suppliers, or the purchasing prices it negotiates) cause or contribute to
negative impacts in the supply chain.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its procurement practice-related impacts.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined procurement practices to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s procurement practice-related impacts
(Disclosure 204-1).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).

Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
7 GRI 204: Procurement Practices 2016
1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined procurement practices to be a material topic is required to report how it manages
the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages procurement practices using
REQUIREMENTS
Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
The reporting organization can also:
GUIDANCE
• describe actions taken to identify and adjust the organization’s procurement practices that
cause or contribute to negative impacts in the supply chain, including:
- how dialogue with suppliers is used to identify procurement practices that cause or
contribute to negative impacts in the supply chain;
- actions taken to adjust payment policies and procedures;
• describe policies and practices used to select locally-based suppliers, either organization-
wide or for specific locations;
• explain the rationale and methodology for tracing the source, origin, or production conditions
of raw materials and production inputs purchased, if applicable;
• describe policies and practices used to promote economic inclusion when selecting
suppliers.
Procurement practices that cause or contribute to negative impacts in the supply chain can
include:
• stability or length of relationships with suppliers;
• lead times;
• ordering and payment routines;
• purchasing prices;
• changing or cancelling orders.
Forms of economic inclusion can include:
• small and medium-sized suppliers;
• suppliers owned by women;
• suppliers which are owned by or recruit workers from members of vulnerable, marginalized,
or under-represented social groups.
8 GRI 204: Procurement Practices 2016
2. Topic disclosures
An organization is expected to compile information for economic disclosures using figures from its audited financial
statements or from its internally-audited management accounts, whenever possible. Data can be compiled using, for
example:
• the relevant International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), published by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB), and the Interpretations developed by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (specific IFRS
are referenced for some of the disclosures);
• the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the International Federation of
Accountants (IFAC);
• national or regional standards recognized internationally for the purpose of financial reporting.
Disclosure 204-1 Proportion of spending on local suppliers
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Percentage of the procurement budget used for significant locations of operation that is
spent on suppliers local to that operation (such as percentage of products and services
purchased locally).
b. The organization’s geographical definition of ‘local’.
c. The definition used for ‘significant locations of operation’.
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 204-1, the reporting organization
RECOMMENDATIONS
should calculate the percentages based on invoices or commitments made during the
reporting period, e.g, using accruals accounting.
Guidance for Disclosure 204-1
GUIDANCE
Local purchases can be made either from a budget managed at the location of operation or at
an organization’s headquarters.
Background
By supporting local suppliers, an organization can indirectly attract additional investment to the
local economy. Local sourcing can be a strategy to help ensure supply, support a stable local
economy, and maintain community relations.
