Introduction
GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their biodiversity-related
impacts, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains three disclosures, which provide information about how the organization manages its
biodiversity-related impacts.
• Section 2 contains five disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s biodiversity-related
impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing
this Standard, as well as resources that the organization can consult.
• The Appendix includes criteria for identifying ecologically sensitive areas, methods to measure or estimate
ecosystem condition, and examples of templates for presenting information for Disclosures 101-5, 101-6, 101-7,
and 101-8.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of biodiversity.
Biodiversity encompasses the variability of organisms living in terrestrial, marine, and aquatic ecosystems, as well as
the ecological complexes they form. It comprises the genetic diversity within species, the variety of species in an area,
and the distinct features of entire ecosystems. Biodiversity is an essential characteristic of nature, which comprises
all living and non-living elements on Earth.
The activities of an organization can exacerbate the direct drivers of biodiversity loss, such as land and sea use
change, exploitation of natural resources, climate change, pollution, and the introduction of invasive alien species.
Direct drivers have impacts on species and ecosystems while affecting people who rely on ecosystem services for
their livelihood.
An organization can have impacts on biodiversity through its activities, the activities of its business relationships, or a
combination of both. These impacts can also extend beyond the geographic locations of the organization’s activities.
The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity sets goals and targets
to halt and reverse the continued loss of biodiversity. The UN adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as
part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These goals include key targets for halting biodiversity loss
and promoting the sustainable use of natural resources under SDG 14: Life below water and SDG 15: Life on land.
See references [2] and [3] in the Bibliography.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
5 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its biodiversity-related impacts. In addition to this Standard, disclosures that
relate to this topic can be found in:
• GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018
• GRI 305: Emissions 2016
• GRI 306: Effluents and Waste 2016 (Disclosure 306-3 Significant spills)
• GRI 411: Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2016
• GRI 413: Local Communities 2016
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined biodiversity to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s biodiversity-related impacts
(Disclosure 101-1 through Disclosure 101-8).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
6 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
7 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined biodiversity to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic
using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021. The organization is also required to report any disclosures from
this section (Disclosure 101-1 through Disclosure 101-3) that are relevant to its biodiversity-related impacts.
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
Disclosure 101-1 Policies to halt and reverse biodiversity loss
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. describe its policies or commitments to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, and how
these are informed by the 2050 Goals and 2030 Targets in the Kunming-Montreal Global
Biodiversity Framework;
b. report the extent to which these policies or commitments apply to the organization’s
activities and to its business relationships;
c. report the goals and targets to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, whether they are
informed by scientific consensus, the base year, and the indicators used to evaluate
progress.
The Convention on Biological Diversity adopted the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity
GUIDANCE
Framework (hereafter the Global Biodiversity Framework). The Global Biodiversity Framework
lays out its 2050 vision of a world ‘living in harmony with nature’ where ‘biodiversity is valued,
conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy
planet and delivering benefits essential for all people’.
The Global Biodiversity Framework recognizes the need to reduce or reverse the drivers of
biodiversity loss. The framework proposes the 2050 Goals, together with the related 2030
Targets. The goals with the related targets are designed to stimulate efforts in three key areas:
• reducing the threats to biodiversity;
• meeting people’s needs through sustainable use and benefit-sharing; and
• providing tools and solutions for implementing and integrating practices that conserve and
sustainably use biodiversity.
See reference [3] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-1-a
The organization can provide a high-level description of its policies or commitments to halt and
reverse biodiversity loss. For example, the organization can describe that it has implemented a
policy in line with Target 5 of the Global Biodiversity Framework to source from suppliers that
take appropriate measures to prevent exporting species that are alien and invasive to the buying
country.
If the policies or commitments to halt and reverse biodiversity loss are not informed by the 2050
Goals and 2030 Targets in the Global Biodiversity Framework, a brief statement of this fact is
sufficient to comply with the requirement. The organization can explain if it intends to do so and,
if so, by which timeframe.
If the organization has described its policies or commitments to halt and reverse biodiversity
loss under Disclosure 2-23 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 or under 3-3-c in GRI 3: Material
Topics 2021, it can provide a reference to this information under 101-1-a and does not need to
repeat the information.
8 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
Guidance to 101-1-b
If the policies or commitments apply to all of the organization’s activities and business
relationships equally, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement.
If the policies or commitments apply to only some of the organization’s activities (e.g., they apply
only to entities located in certain countries or to certain subsidiaries) or to some of its business
relationships (e.g., they apply only to suppliers), then the organization should report to which
activities and business relationships the policies or commitments apply. It can also explain why
the policies or commitments are limited to these activities and business relationships.
The organization should also explain whether its business relationships are obligated to abide
by the policies or commitments, or are encouraged (but not obligated) to do so. When its
business relationships are encouraged to abide by the policies or commitments, the
organization can describe how it encourages adoption and what incentives or support it
provides.
Guidance to 101-1-c
To halt and reverse biodiversity loss, the organization may have goals and targets to achieve net
positive impact, no net loss and net gain of biodiversity, or to contribute to nature positive goals.
In such a case, the organization should explain how it has defined these concepts and list the
sources used to inform its definition.
When reporting on goals and targets, the organization should report how the goals and targets
are set. For example, it can use the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) target-setting tools
and guidance [37] or the SBTN and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures
(TNFD) Guidance for corporates on science-based targets for nature [40].
The organization should report how scientific consensus informed its goals and targets. For
example, it can use national biodiversity strategies and action plans developed in the context of
the Convention on Biological Diversity, or independent assessments of the ecological status of
an area.
The organization should also report the baseline for the goals and targets and the timeline for
achieving the goals and targets.
When reporting progress toward the goals and targets and assessing if the progress is
satisfactory, the organization can, for example, report that it sourced 60% of deforestation-free
products in 2023. It can further report that it is on track to achieve its target of sourcing 100%
deforestation-free products by 31 December 2030.
See references [37] and [40] in the Bibliography.
9 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
Disclosure 101-2 Management of biodiversity impacts
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. report how it applies the mitigation hierarchy by describing:
i. actions taken to avoid negative impacts on biodiversity;
ii. actions taken to minimize negative impacts on biodiversity that were not avoided;
iii. actions taken to restore and rehabilitate affected ecosystems, including the goals
of the restoration and rehabilitation, and how stakeholders are engaged
throughout the restoration and rehabilitation actions;
iv. actions taken to offset residual negative impacts on biodiversity;
v. transformative actions taken and additional conservation actions taken;
b. with reference to 101-2-a-iii, report for each site with the most significant impacts on
biodiversity:
i. the size in hectares of the area under restoration or rehabilitation;
ii. the size in hectares of the area restored or rehabilitated;
c. with reference to 101-2-a-iv, report for each offset:
i. the goals;
ii. the geographic location;
iii. whether and how principles of good offset practices are met;
iv. whether and how the offset is certified or verified by a third party;
d. list which of its sites with the most significant impacts on biodiversity have a
biodiversity management plan and explain why the other sites do not have a
management plan;
e. describe how it enhances synergies and reduces trade-offs between actions taken to
manage its biodiversity and climate change impacts;
f. describe how it ensures that the actions taken to manage its impacts on biodiversity
avoid and minimize negative impacts and maximize positive impacts for stakeholders.
This disclosure provides information on the actions taken by the organization to manage its
GUIDANCE
most significant impacts on biodiversity, including impacts in its supply chain. This disclosure
covers the most significant impacts at the sites and for the products and services in the supply
chain identified under Disclosure 101-4. The organization can manage its negative impacts by
managing the contribution to the direct drivers of biodiversity loss reported under Disclosure
101-6 (e.g., avoid pollution or minimize greenhouse gas emissions). The organization should
also report actions taken to manage impacts downstream in its value chain.
Organizations are expected to apply the mitigation hierarchy to manage their negative impacts
on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The mitigation hierarchy consists of steps, including
avoidance, minimization, restoration and rehabilitation, and offset. An organization should
prioritize actions to avoid negative impacts and minimize those impacts when avoidance is not
possible. Restoration and rehabilitation measures should be implemented when negative
impacts cannot be avoided or minimized. After applying all other measures, offsetting measures
can also be applied to residual negative impacts to achieve no net loss or net gain. Building on
the mitigation hierarchy, the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) Initial Guidance for
Business [38] includes an additional step to cover transformative actions, which aim to change
the socio-economic systems in which organizations are embedded. Additional conservation
actions can be taken to create a positive impact on biodiversity beyond the management of the
organization’s negative impacts.
For more information on the mitigation hierarchy, see the Cross Sector Biodiversity Initiative
(CSBI) A cross-sector guide for implementing the Mitigation Hierarchy [15] and the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable
Management of Living Natural Resources [25].
10 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
This disclosure covers actions taken at the site level and at the organizational level (e.g., a ban
on sourcing a certain product across the entire organization).
The organization should describe the traceability mechanisms it uses to identify the origin of
products and entities in its supply chain. The organization should also describe actions taken to
improve traceability. The organization should explain whether it sources products certified by a
third party and specify the certification schemes or standards used. Third-party certification can
provide information on whether the products sourced adhere to sustainable management
practices. The organization should explain how these certification schemes or standards help
manage impacts on biodiversity, as they use different criteria related to biodiversity conservation.
The organization can also report the percentage of certified products sourced.
The organization should describe how it works with its suppliers to manage their negative
impacts on biodiversity, for example, by providing them with financial or technical support to
change their practices.
The organization should describe how it works with other organizations and stakeholders to
manage cumulative impacts. For example, an organization can describe how it works with other
organizations and the local community to reduce their combined water withdrawal to mitigate the
negative impact on biodiversity. The organization’s activities may facilitate other organizations
and stakeholders to cause impacts on biodiversity. In such a case, the organization should
describe how it works with other organizations and stakeholders to manage these impacts. For
example, consider an organization that has constructed an access road to a new site. This
access road also becomes a pathway to previously inaccessible areas for individuals engaged
in hunting. In this example, the organization can describe how it works with the government to
limit the use of this road.
Where applicable, the organization should also describe actions taken to ensure the
conservation and sustainable use of marine resources in areas beyond national jurisdictions.
See references [9], [15], [25] and [38] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-2-a-i
Avoidance actions aim to anticipate and prevent negative impacts on biodiversity before actions
or decisions leading to such impacts are taken. Impacts can be avoided by finding alternative
locations for the activities (e.g., relocating the site), changing the timing of the activities (e.g.,
timing activities when they do not interfere with a species' breeding or migration), or by deciding
not to undertake activities when they generate irremediable biodiversity losses (e.g., deciding
against expanding the site). Organizations are expected to prioritize avoidance as the primary
step in the mitigation hierarchy.
The organization should explain if it avoids activities in or near ecologically sensitive areas, such
as protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas. See Disclosure 101-5 and Table 1 in the
Appendix for more information on ecologically sensitive areas.
See references [7] and [15] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-2-a-ii
Actions taken to minimize negative impacts on biodiversity aim to reduce the duration, intensity,
and extent of impacts that cannot be completely avoided. The organization should explain why
the impacts could not be avoided.
Examples of minimization measures include preventing the spread of invasive alien species,
designing ecological corridors to minimize ecosystem fragmentation, or locating sites to areas
that are less sensitive to an organization’s activities.
See references [11], [15] and [25] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-2-a-iii
This requirement covers the actions taken to restore or rehabilitate ecosystems that are affected
by the organization’s activities. Actions taken outside of the area affected by the organization’s
activities are reported as offsets under 101-2-a-iv or as additional conservation actions under
101-2-a-v. Restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been
degraded, damaged, or destroyed. Rehabilitation is the process of stabilizing the terrain,
11 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
ensuring public safety, enhancing aesthetics, and restoring the land to a purpose deemed
useful within the regional context. Actions taken to restore and rehabilitate affected ecosystems
aim to return the environment to its original state or to a state where it has a healthy and
functioning ecosystem.
The organization should specify if the restoration and rehabilitation actions are implemented
while the organization's activities are ongoing or after the activities have ended (e.g., restoration
actions taken after the closure of a site). The organization should also report the stage of its
restoration and rehabilitation actions. Examples of stages of restoration and rehabilitation are
as follows:
• planning and design;
• implementation;
• monitoring, documentation, evaluation, and reporting;
• ongoing activities and maintenance.
The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration has identified principles that detail best practices for
restoring degraded land, freshwater, and marine ecosystems.
The organization should provide information on the species and ecosystems targeted through
the restoration and rehabilitation actions. The organization should also explain how these
actions support species recovery.
When reporting on the goals of the restoration and rehabilitation, the organization can report to
what extent the actions are proportional, viable, and measurable. ‘Proportional’ means that the
area targeted for restoration or rehabilitation is equivalent in size to the area that has been
affected. ‘Viable’ means that no known constraints can hinder the successful implementation of
the restoration or rehabilitation in the short, medium, and long term, and the set goals are
attainable based on the current ecological assessment results. An example of short, medium
and long term restoration and rehabilitation is that the land ownership is not limited in time.
’Measurable’ means that objectives have been defined and are regularly monitored.
Stakeholder engagement can include co-design, co-management, co-governance, and regular
and inclusive reporting and communication of activities.
Organizations are expected to obtain free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) before and
throughout restoration and rehabilitation activities that could have impacts on land or resources
that Indigenous Peoples use or own. Organizations are also expected to seek FPIC when
restoration and rehabilitation activities have impacts on land or resources that local
communities use or own.
See references [8], [9] and [19] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-2-a-iv
Offsets are management interventions in areas not affected by the organization’s activities.
These can include the restoration or rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems or actions taken to
halt and reverse biodiversity loss.
The organization should report the types of offsets used. Examples of biodiversity offsets include
averted loss, restoration, and one-off offsets.
The organization should report the phases that the offset projects are in, for example, design,
implementation, or completion. It should also report the delivery deadlines and the conservation
goals.
The organization should also report the co-benefits and trade-offs associated with the offsets,
and how those trade-offs are managed. Examples of co-benefits include the capture and
storage of carbon and social or cultural benefits. An example of a trade-off would be replacing
non-native trees with native trees, while the local community preferred the non-native species for
the purpose of firewood.
See reference [55] in the Bibliography.
12 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
Guidance to 101-2-a-v
Transformative actions contribute to systemic change inside and outside the organization’s
value chain to generate positive impacts on biodiversity. They address the drivers of biodiversity
loss through technological, economic, institutional, and social factors, emphasizing the
importance of underlying values and behavioral changes. Transformative actions can happen
before, during, and after other avoidance, minimization, restoration and rehabilitation, and offset
actions. Transformative actions include actions taken with third parties (e.g., experts,
governments, local communities), and actions that enable other organizations to generate
positive impacts on biodiversity.
The organization can describe how it ensures that its business model is compatible with the
transition to halt and reverse biodiversity loss or the steps taken to transition to a circular
economy. The organization can also describe actions that advance the sustainable use of
biodiversity, for example, promoting farming practices that support biodiversity.
Additional conservation actions aim to have a positive impact on biodiversity and should not be
used to manage the organization’s negative impacts. They include actions taken to conserve or
restore biodiversity in collaboration with third parties, such as scientific experts, non-
governmental organizations, or local communities. For example, joint research projects,
technical and scientific cooperation, capacity-building, training, or knowledge sharing.
See reference [38] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-2-b
Requirement 101-2-b provides information about the size of the area under restoration or
rehabilitation and the size of the area restored or rehabilitated for each site with the most
significant impacts on biodiversity. The sites with the most significant impacts are those
reported under 101-5-a. This information can be compared to the size of the ecosystem affected
by the organization’s activities reported under 101-7-a-ii. It can also be compared to the size of
the site reported under 101-5-a. These comparisons provide insight into how much of the
affected area is under restoration and rehabilitation and how much has been restored and
rehabilitated.
See references [15] and [25] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-2-c-i
An offset aims to deliver or contribute to no net loss or net gain goals for a site, a species, or
other biodiversity features. The organization can report the delivered outcomes in the case an
offset has been finalized.
The organization should report how the goal to achieve no net loss or net gain is demonstrated
and verified. The organization should provide information on the species and ecosystems
targeted through the actions to offset its residual negative impacts.
The organization can also report the residual negative impacts of its activities. It can apply a no
net loss and loss-gain calculation as described in the Business and Biodiversity Offsets
Programme (BBOP) Resource Paper: No Net Loss and Loss-Gain Calculations in Biodiversity
Offsets [10].
See references [10], [15] and [55] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-2-c-iii
The organization should explain whether it identifies, designs, and manages offsets according
to applicable national legislation or principles of good offset practices, such as the BBOP
Standard on Biodiversity Offsets [11] or the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
Policy on Biodiversity Offsets [26]. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) Biodiversity Offsets: Effective Design and Implementation [33] also provides lessons
learned and insights on good practices, such as additionality, ecological equivalence, and
permanence.
‘Additionality’ is a property of a biodiversity offset, where the conservation outcomes are
demonstrably new and additional and would not have resulted without the offset (e.g., weed
control measures required by legislation cannot contribute to an offset). As no two areas are
13 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
ecologically identical, ‘ecological equivalence’ means that the biodiversity gains from the offset
must be equivalent to the residual impacts. ‘Permanence’ means that the offsets must provide
biodiversity gains that correspond to the duration of the biodiversity loss from the residual
impacts.
See references [11], [26] and [33] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-2-d
Requirement 101-2-d provides information about which sites with the most significant impacts
on biodiversity have a biodiversity management plan. The sites with the most significant impacts
are those reported under 101-5-a.
A biodiversity management plan describes how the actions to manage biodiversity impacts are
implemented within a particular site. It includes a monitoring plan, a time schedule, milestones,
and targets. The plans to manage biodiversity impacts may be integrated into broader site
environmental management plans.
Guidance to 101-2-e
Synergies include actions taken to protect biodiversity that contribute to climate change
mitigation or adaptation. Actions can also improve the capacity of species or ecosystems to
adapt to unavoidable climate change impacts. For example, planting mangroves can protect
biodiversity by increasing the wildlife population and contribute to climate change mitigation and
adaptation by capturing and storing carbon and controlling floods.
In contrast, trade-offs include climate change mitigation or adaptation actions that result in
biodiversity loss. For example, foresting an area with non-native species may contribute to
climate change mitigation and adaptation by absorbing greenhouse gases and controlling
erosion. However, it may also result in the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services that flow
from the affected ecosystems.
If the organization does not enhance synergies or reduce trade-offs between actions taken to
manage its biodiversity and climate change impacts, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to
comply with the requirement.
Guidance to 101-2-f
Actions taken to manage impacts on biodiversity may lead to negative impacts on stakeholders.
For example, when an organization’s offset measures form a new protected area restricting the
local community from using the area and accessing natural resources.
The organization should report which stakeholders are affected or potentially affected and
explain how it identifies, addresses, and monitors the negative and positive impacts on
stakeholders. The organization should explain how it engages with stakeholders to identify and
avoid negative impacts that are considered unacceptable and cannot be mitigated or
compensated for. It should also describe the actions taken to achieve equitable social
outcomes. For example, a privately owned protected area invests part of its revenue from
tourism in local energy and healthcare projects, but it restricts local communities from utilizing
the land for agricultural purposes. The organization should also explain how it engages with
stakeholders and describe any conflict resolution or grievance mechanisms it has
implemented. For more information on good practice principles to generate positive social
outcomes while mitigating biodiversity impacts, see reference [8] in the Bibliography.

a. describe the process to ensure compliance with access and benefit-sharing
regulations and measures;
b. describe voluntary actions taken to advance access and benefit-sharing that are
additional to legal obligations or when there are no regulations and measures.
This disclosure provides information on how the organization complies with access and benefit-
GUIDANCE
sharing (ABS) regulations and measures regarding access to genetic resources and
associated traditional knowledge held by Indigenous Peoples and local communities. These
regulations and measures also establish the rules on fair and equitable benefit-sharing arising
from the utilization of genetic resources and the associated traditional knowledge. It also
provides information on the voluntary actions taken by the organization to advance access and
fair and equitable benefit-sharing.
This disclosure is relevant for organizations that use genetic resources to conduct research and
development on the genetic or biochemical composition of resources, including through the
application of biotechnology. It also applies to organizations that use traditional knowledge
associated with genetic resources. These organizations are active in cosmetics,
pharmaceuticals, and agriculture, among other sectors.
The fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources is one
of the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Nagoya Protocol on Access to
Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization
(hereafter the Nagoya Protocol) further advances this objective.
The organization can consult the ABS Clearing-House [13] for more information on ABS. The
platform intends to provide information on national regulations and measures for accessing
genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge. In addition, national focal points might
be established to provide information on ABS on the national level.
When countries lack ABS regulations and measures, an organization can still take action to
share the benefits arising from its use of genetic resources and associated traditional
knowledge fairly and equitably. These actions are referred to as voluntary actions.
The Nagoya Protocol does not cover ABS of genetic resources and associated traditional
knowledge found in areas of the sea that are beyond national jurisdiction. Under the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea, an agreement has been adopted to conserve and sustain
marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. This agreement covers access
and benefit-sharing of marine genetic resources, including the digital genetic sequence
information of resources located in areas beyond national jurisdiction. If an organization has
activities on the sea beyond national jurisdiction, it can report if it implements processes and
actions to ensure access and fair and equitable benefit-sharing of marine genetic resources.
See references [1], [2], [4] and [13] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-3-a
Where ABS regulations and measures apply, the organization should describe:
• how it allocates responsibility to ensure compliance with ABS regulations and measures
across different levels within the organization;
• how it identifies which provider countries have access and benefit-sharing regulations and
measures;
• how it integrates ABS regulations and measures into organizational strategies, operational
policies, and operational procedures;
• what training it provides on implementing the ABS regulations and measures.
When the organization has identified significant instances of non-compliance with laws and
regulations related to ABS, these are reported under Disclosure 2-27 in GRI 2: General
Disclosures 2021.
15 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
Guidance to 101-3-b
Examples of voluntary actions include joint research projects, training, or knowledge sharing
related to using genetic resources or associated traditional knowledge in research and
innovation. The ABS Clearing-House [13] includes examples of good practices, codes of
conduct, guidelines, and standards. The UN Nagoya Protocol [4] lists examples of monetary
and non-monetary benefits, which can inform the organization’s voluntary actions.
The organization can report how engagement with stakeholders, particularly Indigenous
Peoples and local communities, has informed its voluntary actions.
If the organization has not taken any voluntary actions to advance access and fair and equitable
benefit-sharing, a brief statement of this fact is sufficient to comply with the requirement.
See references [4] and [13] in the Bibliography.

2. Topic disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report any disclosures from this section
(Disclosure 101-4 through Disclosure 101-8) that are relevant to its biodiversity-related impacts.
Disclosure 101-4 Identification of biodiversity impacts
The organization shall:
REQUIREMENTS
a. explain how it has determined which of its sites and which products and services in its
supply chain have the most significant actual and potential impacts on biodiversity.
This disclosure enables the organization to explain how it has determined which of its sites and
GUIDANCE
which products and services in its supply chain have the most significant actual and potential
impacts on biodiversity. It covers products and services from suppliers throughout the
organization’s supply chain, including from suppliers beyond the first tier. This provides an
understanding of where in the supply chain, potentially many tiers removed from the
organization, the most significant impacts on biodiversity are. The organization can additionally
report the information for entities downstream in its value chain.
The activities undertaken by the organization in its sites can have impacts on biodiversity. Sites
include sites owned, leased, or managed by the organization and locations where it conducts its
activities. Examples are a mine site owned by an organization or a fishing ground where an
organization operates. Sites also include those for which future operations have been
announced but not yet started, as well as those no longer active. Sites include subsurface
infrastructures under the land or seabed surface, such as underground mining tunnels, cables,
and pipelines.
The organization may also be involved with negative impacts on biodiversity as a result of its
business relationships with suppliers. Suppliers are entities upstream from the organization,
which provide products or services used to develop the organization’s own products or services.
The activities undertaken by the suppliers to develop their products or services can have
impacts on biodiversity. Suppliers that provide products to the organization can provide raw
materials, semi-manufactured goods, or final products.
Guidance to 101-4-a
The organization should describe the methods used and the assumptions made to determine
which of its sites and which products and services in its supply chain have the most significant
actual and potential impacts on biodiversity.
It is up to the organization to set the threshold to determine which sites and which products and
services in its supply chain have the most significant impacts on biodiversity. For example, the
organization can determine that all of its sites have the most significant impacts on biodiversity,
except for its headquarters. An organization that sources many products or services can
determine to prioritize the products or services in its supply chain that are likely to have the most
significant impacts on biodiversity and of which it sources a high volume or on which it spends a
large amount.
The organization should describe any limitations or exclusions, for example, whether it has
excluded certain parts of its supply chain when identifying the impacts.
The organization should describe the sources and the evidence it has used to identify the
impacts. It should also explain whether and how it engages with stakeholders to identify
impacts on biodiversity.
17 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
The organization should explain which information draws on primary, secondary, or modeled
data. When reporting secondary or modeled data, the organization should report which datasets
it has used and if it plans to improve the accuracy of data.
Most significant impacts on biodiversity
The following provides guidance for organizations on how to identify the most significant
impacts on biodiversity. The organization is not required to comply with this guidance.
Locating where impacts are most likely to be present and significant
The organization should identify impacts on biodiversity across its sites, and products and
services in its supply chain. In some cases, the organization might be unable to identify actual
and potential negative impacts across all its sites, and products and services in its supply
chain. This could be, for example, because the organization has diverse or multiple global
operations or because its supply chain comprises many entities. In such cases, the
organization may carry out an initial assessment or scoping exercise to identify general areas
across its sites and products and services in its supply chain (e.g., product lines, suppliers
located in specific geographic locations) where negative impacts are most likely to be present
and significant.
Once the organization has conducted the initial assessment or scoping exercise, it can identify
and assess actual and potential negative impacts for these general areas.
Activities undertaken by organizations lead or could lead to direct drivers of biodiversity loss
(hereafter direct drivers). These direct drivers can in turn lead to impacts on biodiversity and
related ecosystem services. To identify which activities in its operations and supply chain are
likely to have the most significant impacts on biodiversity, the organization can use the following:
• The ENCORE tool and the SBTN Materiality Screening Tool1 provide ratings of materiality for
direct drivers associated with different activities.
• The SBTN High Impact Commodity List2 shows the direct drivers commonly associated with
the production of the high-impact commodities on the list.
The organization can also prioritize products that are or contain threatened species listed in the
IUCN Red List of Threatened Species or species listed in the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendices.3
Activities that occur in different geographic locations can have different impacts on biodiversity,
depending on factors such as the sensitivity of the local ecosystem, the presence of threatened
species, or people’s reliance on a natural resource. Information on the location of the
organization’s sites, and its suppliers’ activities and their proximity to ecologically sensitive
areas, helps understand where these activities could be particularly harmful to biodiversity.
The organization should assess which of its sites are in or near ecologically sensitive areas. If
the organization has information about the location of its suppliers, it can also assess which of
those suppliers are in or near ecologically sensitive areas. See Disclosure 101-5 and Table 1 in
the Appendix for more information on ecologically sensitive areas.
The organization can refer to the Scoping and Locate phases of the Taskforce on Nature-related
Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Guidance on the identification and assessment of nature-related
issues: The LEAP approach [41] for more guidance on locating where impacts are most likely to
be present and significant.
Identification of the most significant impacts
To identify and assess the significance of its impacts on biodiversity, the organization should
identify and measure the direct drivers associated with the activities in its operations and its
1 The scores generated by the SBTN Materiality Screening Tool are calculated using the ENCORE impact materiality database. The scores reflect a
high-level understanding of impacts at a global or non-spatially explicit level and are expressed as a sectoral average or typical impact profile of an
organization in the given sector.
2 SBTN defines high-impact commodities as raw and value-added materials used in economic activities that are known to have material links to the key
drivers of biodiversity loss, resource depletion, and ecosystem degradation.
3 Species+ contains information on all species that are listed in the CITES Appendices.
18 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
supply chain, as well as identify and measure the changes to the state of biodiversity. It can also
identify changes in the provision of ecosystem services.
If no primary data is available, the organization can estimate the direct drivers and changes to
the state of biodiversity. The indicators in Disclosure 101-6 can be used to measure the direct
drivers (e.g., the size of the natural ecosystem converted, or the quantity of the
pollutants generated). See Disclosure 101-7 for more information on changes to the state of
biodiversity.
To determine which of the impacts are most significant, the organization should assess the
severity and likelihood of the impacts. The severity of a negative impact is determined by the
following characteristics:
• Scale: how grave the impact is.
• Scope: how widespread the impact is, for example, the number of species affected or the
extent of ecosystem damage.
• Irremediable character: how hard it is to counteract or make good the resulting harm.
Any of the three characteristics (scale, scope, and irremediable character) can make an impact
severe.
The contribution to the direct drivers, the proximity to ecologically sensitive areas, and the
changes to the state of biodiversity can make the severity and likelihood of an impact on
biodiversity greater. For example, when a site or supplier is in or near an ecologically sensitive
area, it can increase the likelihood of an impact on biodiversity. When a site or supplier is in or
near an ecosystem close to a tipping point, or where threatened species are present, it can
increase the severity of an impact on biodiversity, for example, because the impact would result
in irremediable harm.
See section 1 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 for more guidance on assessing the significance
of impacts. For more guidance on how to identify biodiversity impacts, the organization can use
the following sources:
• Aligning accounting approaches for nature (Align) Recommendations and implementation
guidance;
• Natural Capital Protocol from the Natural Capital Coalition;
• Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) Technical Guidance: Step 1: Assess;
• The Locate and Evaluate phases of the TNFD LEAP approach.
Methodologies
Where possible, the organization should use primary data to identify its sites and products and
services in its supply chain with the most significant impacts on biodiversity (e.g., using data
collected through field or supplier surveys or derived from satellite imagery).
The organization can use secondary or modeled data when primary data is unavailable (e.g.,
data layers on ecosystem extent and condition, life cycle impact assessments). For example,
the organization can use secondary data to identify and measure changes to the state of
biodiversity. In such a case, geospatial data layers can be overlaid with geographic location data
to reflect the size and condition of ecosystems or identify species that may be present at specific
sites. For example, the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter4 [57] provides information on the ecosystem
condition in different locations and the direct drivers most likely to be present and significant for
an organization’s or its suppliers’ activities.
Secondary data may be appropriate to gain initial information about an organization’s impacts
on biodiversity across its sites and products and services in its supply chain. Once the sites and
products and services in its supply chain with the most significant impacts have been identified,
the organization may collect primary data for those sites and products and services in its supply
chain.
The organization should use precise locations to assess the proximity to ecologically sensitive
areas and to assess the changes to the state of biodiversity.
4 The WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter includes over 50 global datasets on biodiversity, which provide information on a sector’s potential contributions to
direct drivers of biodiversity loss, proximity to ecologically sensitive areas, and the state of biodiversity (species and ecosystems).
19 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
For products and services in its supply chain, the organization can use sourcing regions or
countries if it does not know the precise locations of its suppliers. The organization can also use
life cycle assessment tools, pressure or impact assessment tools, and global trade datasets to
make assumptions about likely locations, which are usually countries associated with its supply
chain (e.g., the soy used in its products is likely to come from the United States, Brazil, or
Argentina).
The organization can use the data it has collected on the direct drivers, the proximity to
ecologically sensitive areas, and the changes to the state of biodiversity to identify its impacts on
biodiversity for reporting the information required under Disclosures 101-5 to 101-8.
See references [14], [20], [27], [32], [35], [36], [39], [41], [47], [48], [49], [51] and [57] in the

Disclosure 101-5 Locations with biodiversity impacts
REQUIREMENTS
The organization shall:
a. report the location and size in hectares of its sites with the most significant impacts on
biodiversity;
b. for each site reported under 101-5-a, report whether it is in or near an ecologically
sensitive area, the distance to these areas, and whether these are:
i. areas of biodiversity importance;
ii. areas of high ecosystem integrity;
iii. areas of rapid decline in ecosystem integrity;
iv. areas of high physical water risks;
v. areas important for the delivery of ecosystem service benefits to Indigenous
Peoples, local communities, and other stakeholders;
c. report the activities that take place in each site reported under 101-5-a;
d. report the products and services in its supply chain with the most significant impacts
on biodiversity and the countries or jurisdictions where the activities associated with
these products and services take place.
This disclosure provides information about the locations of the organization’s sites with the
GUIDANCE
most significant impacts on biodiversity. It also provides information on the location of the
activities associated with the products and services in its supply chain with the most significant
impacts on biodiversity. The sites and products and services with the most significant impacts
on biodiversity are identified under Disclosure 101-4. These sites and products and services
are the focus of Disclosure 101-2 and Disclosures 101-5 to 101-8 of this Standard.
If available, the organization can additionally report the information for entities downstream in its
value chain with the most significant impacts on biodiversity.
For an example of how to present information on requirements in Disclosure 101-5, see Tables
3 and 4 in the Appendix.
Guidance to 101-5-a
The organization should use polygon outlines or maps to report on the location of its sites with
the most significant impacts on biodiversity. A polygon is a geographic feature defined by a
series of grid references, points, or vertices connected to form an enclosed shape. If available,
the organization should also report the names and coordinates of its sites.
Providing the coordinates for the sites of transport and fishing activities may not be possible. In
these cases, the organization can report departure and arrival locations and transport routes for
transport activities. For fishing activities, it can report FAO major fishing areas and subareas.
See reference [17] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-5-b
The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) defines ecologically sensitive
areas as areas of biodiversity importance, areas of high ecosystem integrity, areas of rapid
decline in ecosystem integrity, areas of high physical water risks, and areas important for the
delivery of ecosystem service benefits to Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and other
stakeholders.
The organization can consult the criteria listed in Table 1 in the Appendix to identify ecologically
sensitive areas. An area is ecologically sensitive when it meets one or more criteria.
For more guidance and examples of tools to identify ecologically sensitive areas, see the TNFD
Guidance on the identification and assessment of nature-related issues: The LEAP approach
[41], pages 57-63.
21 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
A site is in an ecologically sensitive area when it is completely or partially located in the
ecologically sensitive area. A site is near an ecologically sensitive area when the ecologically
sensitive area falls within the area affected or potentially affected (sometimes referred to as the
area of influence) or within the radius set by the organization. The organization can use a radius
if it cannot identify the area affected or potentially affected by its activities. If the organization uses
a radius, it should explain this and report the distance of the radius used.
The organization is required to report the distance only in cases where the site is near an
ecologically sensitive area.
The organization should report the size in hectares of the ecologically sensitive areas within its
sites.
The organization can also report polygon outlines, or maps of the ecologically sensitive areas
and overlay them with the polygon outlines or maps of its sites.
The organization can also report the percentage of sites in or near ecologically sensitive areas.
This information provides a high-level understanding of the significance of biodiversity across
the organization’s operations.
The percentage of sites in or near ecologically sensitive areas is calculated using the following
formula:
Percentage of Number of sites in or near ecologically sensitive areas
sites in or near ___________________________________________
= x 100
ecologically
sensitive areas Total number of sites
See reference [41] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-5-b-i
The organization should specify whether the areas of biodiversity importance are:
• protected through legal or other effective means;
• scientifically recognized for their importance to biodiversity;
• important for species;
• important for ecosystems; or
• important for ecological connectivity.
See Table 1 in the Appendix for more information on areas of biodiversity importance.
Guidance to 101-5-d
Where possible, the organization should also report the location within the country or jurisdiction
(e.g., state, city, Exclusive Economic Zone) or a precise location, such as polygon outlines or
maps. The organization can report departure and arrival locations and transport routes for
transport activities. For fishing activities, it can report FAO major fishing areas and subareas.
For each product and service with the most significant impacts on biodiversity, the organization
should describe the level of traceability in place, for example, whether the product or service can
be traced to the national, regional, or local level, or a specific point of origin (e.g., farms). The
organization can also report the volume sourced or the amount spent on each product and
service.
If available, the organization should also report the information on ecologically sensitive areas
required by 101-5-b for the products and services in its supply chain with the most significant
impacts on biodiversity.
If the products in its supply chain are or contain high-impact commodities5, the organization can
report the quantity of each high-impact commodity sourced (e.g., tons of avocado) and the
5 SBTN defines high-impact commodities as raw and value-added materials used in economic activities that are known to have material links to the key
drivers of biodiversity loss, resource depletion, and ecosystem degradation.

proportion of total high-impact commodities sourced. This information provides a high-level
understanding of the significance of biodiversity across products in the organization’s supply
chain. The organization can use the SBTN High Impact Commodity List to identify whether it
sources products that are or contain high-impact commodities.
The proportion of total high-impact commodities sourced is calculated using the following
formula:

Disclosure 101-6 Direct drivers of biodiversity loss
REQUIREMENTS
The organization shall:
a. for each site reported under 101-5-a where its activities lead or could lead to land and
sea use change, report:
i. the size in hectares of natural ecosystem converted since a cut-off or reference
date, the cut-off date or reference date, and the type of ecosystem before and after
conversion;
ii. the size in hectares of land and sea converted from one intensively used or
modified ecosystem to another during the reporting period, and the type of
ecosystem before and after conversion;
b. for each site reported under 101-5-a where its activities lead or could lead to the
exploitation of natural resources, report:
i. for each wild species harvested, the quantity, the type, and extinction risk;
ii. water withdrawal and water consumption in megaliters;
c. for each site reported under 101-5-a where its activities lead or could lead to pollution,
report the quantity and the type of each pollutant generated;
d. for each site reported under 101-5-a where its activities lead or could lead to the
introduction of invasive alien species, describe how invasive alien species are or may
be introduced;
e. for each product and service in its supply chain reported under 101-5-d, report the
information required under 101-6-a, 101-6-b, 101-6-c, and 101-6-d, with a breakdown by
country or jurisdiction;
f. report contextual information necessary to understand how the data has been
compiled, including standards, methodologies, and assumptions used.
This disclosure provides an understanding of the direct drivers of biodiversity loss (hereafter the
GUIDANCE
direct drivers) leading to the most significant impacts. The organization should additionally
report the information on the direct drivers for its downstream value chain.
According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Services (IPBES), direct drivers are the drivers that ‘unequivocally influence biodiversity and
ecosystem processes’. Direct drivers are sometimes referred to as ‘pressures’ or ‘impact
drivers’. The IPBES global assessment has identified land and sea use change and the
exploitation of natural resources as the main direct drivers, followed by climate change,
pollution, and the introduction of invasive alien species. These direct drivers can also lead to the
fragmentation and degradation of ecosystems. See Box 1 for more information on direct drivers
of biodiversity loss.
Information on the direct drivers informs decisions on prioritizing actions to manage biodiversity-
related impacts by applying the mitigation hierarchy. See Disclosure 101-2 for more information
on the mitigation hierarchy. The organization’s actions to mitigate direct drivers are reported
under Disclosure 101-2.
Through its activities, an organization can use natural resources for its production processes
(e.g., sand used in a construction project) or produce non-product outputs (e.g., pollutants or
greenhouse gas emissions). These activities, responsible for the direct drivers of biodiversity
loss, can have negative impacts on biodiversity.
The organization needs to report only the information for the direct drivers relevant to its activities
and its supply chain. Direct drivers can vary by location. For example, an organization has
activities in site A that lead to pollution. It also has activities in site B that lead to the exploitation
of natural resources. In this case, the organization only needs to report the information on
pollution for site A and on the exploitation of natural resources for site B.
For an example of how to present information on requirements in Disclosure 101-6, see Tables
24 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
3 and 4 in the Appendix. See references [32], [43] and [44] in the Bibliography.
Box 1. Direct drivers of biodiversity loss
Land and sea use change
Land and sea use change refers to how humans use and manage land and seascapes,
which may lead to a change in land and sea cover. These are changes to terrestrial and
aquatic ecosystems, including freshwater and marine ecosystems. Examples of changes in
the use of freshwater ecosystems are the construction of a hydropower dam in a river or the
drainage of a wetland for urban settlements. Land and sea use change results from the
conversion of natural, intensively used, or other modified ecosystems into another
ecosystem.
Exploitation of natural resources
The exploitation of natural resources encompasses the harvest of wild organisms (animal,
fungi, and plant species) and the exploitation of water.
The exploitation of wild species can lead to their extinction. Some of the most exploited
species include marine fish, invertebrates, and trees. Various species are hunted for
bushmeat and harvested for use in the medicinal or pet trade. Unsustainable water use can
lead to loss, fragmentation, and degradation of species habitats, reduce the availability of food
and water for species, as well as disrupt the functioning of ecosystems.
Climate change
Climate change is a direct driver as it alters species’ distribution, functioning, and
interactions, reducing ecosystems’ capacity to adapt. Climate change leads to changes in
temperatures and weather patterns that, in turn, can affect species (e.g., by reducing habitats
and food supply, and altering migration patterns and breeding seasons). Sea level rise and
ocean acidification also negatively affect marine organisms.
The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a particular site may not lead to biodiversity loss
in the direct vicinity of the site but contribute to climate change that drives biodiversity loss.
Therefore, an organization’s GHG emissions and those from other organizations contribute to
climate change as a global direct driver of biodiversity loss.
This disclosure does not require information on climate change. An organization’s GHG
emissions can be reported under Disclosures 305-1, 305-2, and 305-3 in GRI 305: Emissions
2016.
Pollution
Air, water, and soil pollutants include substances (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, solid waste)
and other pollutants such as heat, light, noise, or vibrations.
Emission of pollutants can affect ecosystems and species. The toxicity and persistence of
some pollutants can affect species’ health (e.g., with immune, reproductive, neurotoxic, or
carcinogenic effects). Pesticides and insecticides lead to the decline of pollinators and other
species. Waste not properly disposed of can lead to leaks of hazardous substances into the
environment, while plastic litter accumulates in soil and affects marine species through
entanglement and ingestion. Light and noise can disrupt wildlife species’ breeding or
migration behavior, resulting in a population decline.
Invasive alien species
Invasive alien species are animals, plants, and other organisms that are introduced,
accidentally or deliberately by humans, to an area outside of their natural geographical range
and cause negative impacts on local biodiversity. Invasive alien species negatively affect
biodiversity as they often lack predators in their new environment, allowing them to spread,
become established and abundant. They can carry diseases, outcompete or prey on native
species, alter food chains, and change ecosystems by, for example, altering soil composition
or creating habitats that are vulnerable to wildfires. These impacts can lead to the extinction of
species.
25 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
Guidance to 101-6-a
The organization should report which ecosystem classification it uses to identify the types of
ecosystems converted. The organization can report ecosystem types using the biomes or
ecosystem functional groups in the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology.6 Alternatively, the
organization can report according to another global classification, national classification, or
register. If the organization cannot use ecosystem classifications, it can utilize land use
classifications (e.g., Globio land use categories).
See reference [28] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-6-a-i
The Accountability Framework initiative defines a natural ecosystem as an ecosystem that
substantially resembles – in terms of species composition, structure, and ecological function –
one that is or would be found in a given area without major human impacts. It includes human-
managed ecosystems where much of the natural species composition, structure, and
ecological function are present. Natural ecosystem conversion is the human-induced change of
a natural ecosystem to another use or profound change in an ecosystem's species
composition, structure, or function. It can include severe degradation or introducing
management practices that lead to substantial and sustained change in the ecosystem's former
species composition, structure, or function.
Natural ecosystem conversion is measured from a cut-off date7 associated with an
organization’s policy related to natural ecosystem conversion (e.g., deforestation-free policy). If
the organization does not have such a policy in place, it should select a reference date to
measure natural ecosystem conversion. For instance, if 2015 has been set as a cut-off date or
reference date, the organization reports the size of the ecosystem converted from 2015 until the
reporting period. Common cut-off dates apply to organizations operating in the same or similar
context. They support the monitoring, verification, and management of natural ecosystem
conversion, including in supply chains. Cut-off dates can, therefore, be selected based on
sector-wide or regional cut-off dates (e.g., the 2008 cut-off date from the Brazil Soy Moratorium)
or those specified in certification programs (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council), legislation (e.g.,
EU regulation on deforestation-free products), or voluntary initiatives (e.g., Science Based
Targets for Nature). Cut-off dates may differ between commodities and regions. More guidance
can be found in the Accountability Framework initiative Operational Guidance on Cutoff Dates [6].
The organization should explain why it has determined the cut-off or reference dates as
appropriate.
See references [5] and [6] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-6-a-ii
Intensively used and other modified ecosystems are ecosystems where human activity has
substantially modified an area’s primary ecological functions and species composition to
ecosystems dominated by agriculture, urban, and other industrial activities. Intensively used
ecosystems are those covered by the intensive land-use systems biome (T7) in the IUCN
Global Ecosystem Typology. Other modified ecosystems include anthropogenic subterranean
freshwaters (SF2), artificial freshwaters (F3), anthropogenic marine systems (M4), and
anthropogenic shorelines (MT3).
See reference [28] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-6-b-i
Harvesting wild species involves gathering, catching, or hunting wild organisms (animal, fungi,
and plant species) by the organization, including those incidentally taken.
6 Other ecosystem classifications are aligned with the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology. These include the SEEA Ecosystem Type Reference
Classification [54] and the TNFD list of environmental assets [42].
7 The Accountability Framework initiative defines cut-off date as the date after which natural ecosystem conversion, which may include deforestation,
renders a given area or production unit non-compliant with no-conversion or no-deforestation commitments. A reference date is defined as the date
from which natural ecosystem conversion associated with a given area or supply chain is measured or managed.
26 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
The organization can report if the species are listed in one of the CITES Appendices. It can also
report if the species are harvested from ecologically sensitive areas (e.g., from a Key Biodiversity
Area, which aims to protect or conserve the harvested species).
To report on the extinction risk of a species, the organization can use information from the IUCN
Red List of Threatened Species.
See references [14] and [27] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-6-b-ii
The organization should use information reported under Disclosures 303-3 Water withdrawal
and 303-5 Water consumption in GRI 303: Water and Effluents 20188 to report water withdrawal
and water consumption for each site.
Guidance to 101-6-c
The organization is only required to report the type and quantity of pollutants that lead or could
lead to the most significant impacts on biodiversity.
To report on air pollution, the organization should use, where relevant, information reported
under Disclosure 305-7 Nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and other significant air
emissions in GRI 305: Emissions 2016 for:
• NO;
x
• SO;
x
• Persistent organic pollutants (POP);
• Volatile organic compounds (VOCs);
• Hazardous air pollutants (HAP);
• Particulate matter (PM);
• Other standard categories of air emissions from relevant regulations.
To report on water and soil pollution, the organization should use, where relevant, information
reported under:
• Disclosure 303-4 Water discharge in GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018 to have information
on priority substances of concern that may cause water pollution (e.g., those leading to
eutrophication).
• Disclosure 306-3 Significant spills in GRI 306: Effluents and Waste 2016.
For heat, light, noise, or vibration pollution, the organization should report instances that do not
comply with legal requirements for permitted pollution levels.
Guidance to 101-6-d
Non-invasive alien species are not required to be reported under 101-6-d.
Invasive alien species can be introduced accidentally (e.g., transport, discharge of ballast
waters) or on purpose (e.g., for pest control, horticulture, pets, zoological gardens, and aquaria).
The organization should report the species that are or may be introduced. For example, an
organization imports ornamental plants to new areas, which may threaten local biodiversity. A
maritime shipping organization may introduce shellfish, crustaceans, and other species to new
areas through contaminated ballast water or encrusted organisms on ships. It can also
inadvertently introduce other species, such as insects and rodents, through the transport of
goods.
National regulations define which species are considered invasive alien species in a particular
country. The Global Invasive Species Database and Global Register of Introduced and Invasive
Species also provide information on invasive alien species.
The organization can also describe how those species affect or may affect surrounding species
and ecosystems.
See references [21] and [22] in the Bibliography.
8 The disclosures in GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018, GRI 305: Emissions 2016, and GRI 306: Effluents and Waste 2016 (Disclosure 306-3 Significant
spills) do not require information to be reported by site; they require aggregate information. The organization can refer to the original data sources used
to compile the information for these disclosures to obtain the data by site.
27 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
Guidance to 101-6-e
It may not be feasible for the organization to obtain primary data on direct drivers from suppliers.
In such a case, the organization can estimate the direct drivers using multi-regional input-output
models and lifecycle impact assessments in combination with data on the volume or amount
spent on products and services. Multi-regional input-output models can provide estimates of the
environmental inputs (e.g., water use) and outputs (e.g., air emissions) associated with the
products and services in its supply chain. See Aligning accounting approaches for nature (Align)
Measuring and valuing biodiversity across supply chains [47] for more information on the
methodologies and data to measure direct drivers in supply chains.
If the organization cannot report the size of the natural ecosystem converted for the products in
its supply chain, it can report, for each product, the percentage of sourced volume determined to
be deforestation- or conversion-free and describe the assessment methods used. For example,
out of 100 tons of soy sourced, an organization has determined that 90% is deforestation-free.
Assessment methods can include monitoring, certification, sourcing from low-risk jurisdictions
with no or negligible recent conversion, or sourcing from verified suppliers. To be deemed
conversion- or deforestation-free, products must be assessed as not causing or contributing to
natural ecosystem conversion, including deforestation, after an appropriate cut-off date.
See reference [47] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-6-f
The organization should use primary data to report information on the direct drivers where
possible. When primary data is unavailable, the organization can use secondary or modeled
data (e.g., lifecycle impact assessments). However, such data are less accurate and may not
reflect the effectiveness of actions to manage the organization’s impacts.
The organization should explain which information draws on primary, secondary, or modeled
data, as well as any limitations of methodologies and data used. When reporting secondary or
modeled data, the organization should report which datasets it used and if it plans to improve
the accuracy of data.

Disclosure 101-7 Changes to the state of biodiversity
REQUIREMENTS
The organization shall:
a. for each site reported under 101-5-a, report the following information on affected or
potentially affected ecosystems:
i. the ecosystem type for the base year;
ii. the ecosystem size in hectares for the base year;
iii. the ecosystem condition for the base year and the current reporting period;
b. report contextual information necessary to understand how the data has been
compiled, including standards, methodologies, and assumptions used.
This disclosure provides information about the changes in the condition of the ecosystem
GUIDANCE
affected or potentially affected by the organization.
The state of biodiversity is the holistic quality of the components of biodiversity (genes, species,
and ecosystems), and is a function of the condition and size of its components. This disclosure
focuses on the condition and size of affected ecosystems. By reporting this information for the
base year and the current reporting period, the organization provides information about the
ecosystem's overall health over time.
Changes in the state of biodiversity may reflect the cumulative impacts of the organization's
activities and the activities of others, such as governments, local communities, or other
organizations. It is not always possible to determine how much of the change in the state of
biodiversity is due to the activities of the organization or others. However, the information
reported under this disclosure, together with Disclosure 101-6, helps to understand the
organization’s actual and potential impacts on biodiversity and can inform the management of
these impacts.
The organization should report information on changes to the state of biodiversity for each
product and service reported under 101-5-d by country or jurisdiction. It should also report this
information for its downstream value chain.
The organization can organize the information on the state of biodiversity into structured
biodiversity accounts. Biodiversity accounts enable more accurate monitoring of gains and
losses of biodiversity over time. A core component of biodiversity accounts is the compilation of
an asset inventory for each ecosystem type so that gains in one type do not compensate for
losses in another. They are also useful in tracking progress against targets to halt and reverse
biodiversity loss. See the Endangered Wildlife Trust Biological Diversity Protocol [16] for more
information on biodiversity accounts.
For an example of how to present information on requirements in Disclosure 101-7, see Table 3
in the Appendix.
See references [16] and [54] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-7-a
When reporting information on the affected or potentially affected ecosystems, the organization
should consider all ecosystem types in the area that is or could be affected by its activities,
including beyond its sites, if relevant. The state of the overall ecosystem, which extends beyond
the areas affected by the organization, is not required for reporting. For example, an organization
that owns a soy plantation in the Amazon is required to report information on the type, size, and
condition of the affected part of the ecosystem rather than reporting on the entire Amazon
region.
The base year is when the organization collects baseline information on the ecosystem type,
size, and condition. The base year may be the start of an organization’s activities, the date from
which it owned, leased, or managed a particular site, or when it committed to halt and reverse
biodiversity loss.
29 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
Baseline information can be collected through environmental impact assessments, which
provide information on the condition of and trends in biodiversity in a particular area before an
organization’s activities start. For more information on best practices to conduct baseline
studies, see references [23] and [25] in the Bibliography.
The organization should report the base year. It should report how it has determined the base
year and baseline information under 101-7-b.
The size and condition of an affected ecosystem can be combined into one unit: condition-
adjusted area. This is the size of the ecosystem adjusted for its condition, and the unit (e.g.,
equivalent hectares) represents the residual condition within that area. The organization can
also report impacts on affected ecosystems using condition-adjusted hectares. See Align
Measuring Ecosystem Condition – A primer for business [50] and the Endangered Wildlife Trust
Biological Diversity Protocol [16] for more information on condition-adjusted areas.
See references [16], [23], [25] and [50] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-7-a-i
The organization should report which ecosystem classification it uses to identify the types of
ecosystems. The organization can report ecosystem types using the biomes or ecosystem
functional groups in the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology.9 Alternatively, the organization can
report according to another global classification, national classification, or register. If the
organization cannot use ecosystem classifications, it can use land use classifications (e.g.,
Globio land use categories) instead.
See reference [28] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-7-a-ii
Ecosystem size, also referred to as ecosystem extent, is the area coverage of the ecosystem
that is affected or potentially affected by the organization’s activities. This is a fixed area over
which the condition of the ecosystem is measured over time.
See reference [49] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-7-a-iii
Ecosystem condition is the quality of an ecosystem measured by its living and non-living
characteristics against a reference condition.10 Living and non-living characteristics include:
• the ecosystem’s composition, function, and structure;
• the landscape characteristics (e.g., connectivity); and
• the physical and chemical state characteristics (e.g., soil structure and soil nutrient levels).
Ecosystem condition can also provide information on the ecosystem’s capacity to supply
ecosystem services now and in the future.
The activities of an organization may degrade the condition of affected ecosystems through the
direct drivers of biodiversity loss (hereafter direct drivers). For example, the emission of
pollutants, partial deforestation, or water withdrawal in an area with water stress, may affect the
ecosystem's structure, composition, or function. If land and sea use change is the primary direct
driver of biodiversity loss, the activities of an organization lead to the conversion of an ecosystem
into a different type of ecosystem. In this case, the conversion of the ecosystem results in a
complete reduction in ecosystem condition.
Methods to measure ecosystem condition should reflect the relevant characteristics of the
ecosystem. The organization can use methods that directly measure characteristics or estimate
ecosystem conditions based on direct drivers. These methods can be specific to certain types of
ecosystems (e.g., types of wetlands or forests) or applicable to different ecosystem types (i.e.,
applicable across terrestrial, freshwater, or marine realms). See Table 2 in the Appendix for
examples of methods to measure or estimate ecosystem condition. See Align Measuring
Ecosystem Condition – A primer for business [50] and Taskforce on Nature-related Financial
Disclosures (TNFD) Guidance on the identification and assessment of nature-related issues: The
LEAP approach [41] for more information on how to measure ecosystem condition.
9 Other ecosystem classifications are aligned with the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology. These include the SEEA Ecosystem Type Reference
Classification [54] and the TNFD list of environmental assets [42].
10 A reference condition is used to calibrate the measurement of ecosystem condition over time. It differs from a baseline, which is the condition of the
ecosystem for the base year. See Align Measuring Ecosystem Condition – A primer for business [50] for more information on reference condition.
30 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
If the organization monitors the condition of affected or potentially affected ecosystems at a
frequency different from its sustainability reporting frequency, it should report the most recent
information and does not need additional measurement to meet the requirement.
See references [41], [49], [50] and [54] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-7-b
The organization should use primary data to report on direct drivers where possible (e.g., data
collected through field surveys, eDNA, or derived from satellite imagery).
When primary data is unavailable, the organization can use secondary or modeled data (e.g.,
data layers on ecosystem extent and condition, life cycle impact assessments). Modeled data
are issued from models that quantify how the different direct drivers affect the state of
biodiversity. These models use globally collected data, and the results are applied locally to
estimate how the organization’s activities can lead to ecosystem changes. They include
geospatial data layers that can be used to identify changes in the size and condition of
ecosystems, such as the level of habitat fragmentation and connectivity, or identify species that
may be present at specific sites.
The organization should explain which information draws on primary, secondary, or modeled
data, as well as any limitations of methodologies and data used. When reporting secondary or
modeled data, the organization should report which datasets it has used and if it plans to
improve the accuracy of data.
Guidance to 101-7
The organization should additionally report information on affected or potentially affected
species for the sites reported under 101-5-a. The organization can report the species, its
extinction risk, and population size for the baseline and current reporting period.
The extinction risk measures the threat status of a species and how an organization’s activities
may affect the threat status. The global, regional, and national IUCN Red Lists can be used to
determine the species extinction risk (i.e., Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near
Threatened, and Least Concern). Change in the available species habitat can potentially be
used as a proxy to measure impact on local or global extinction risk, noting that other factors can
drive extinction risk (e.g., hunting, climate change).
Population size measures the number of individuals of a species within an area. It can be
measured by the number of mature individuals or the number of breeding pairs. When the
population size is unavailable, trends in relative population abundance or in species area of
habitat can be used as a proxy.
The organization can report information for the following species:
• Species whose local or overall populations have or could be changed significantly.
• Species that are legally protected by local, national, or international laws and conventions
(e.g., species listed in one of the CITES Appendices).
• Species that are recognized as a priority species at the local, national, or international level
(e.g., species listed as threatened on the international IUCN Red List or species that trigger
a Key Biodiversity Area designation).
• Species that have a critical role in the ecosystem (e.g., keystone species).
• Species that have a significant cultural or economic role for stakeholders (e.g., hunting,
harvesting, pollination).
See references [27] and [49] in the Bibliography.

Disclosure 101-8 Ecosystem services
REQUIREMENTS
The organization shall:
a. for each site reported under 101-5-a, list the ecosystem services and beneficiaries
affected or potentially affected by the organization’s activities;
b. explain how the ecosystem services and beneficiaries are or could be affected by the
organization's activities.
Ecosystem services occur through an ecosystem's normal functioning and can fall into one or
GUIDANCE
more of the following categories:
• provisioning services;
• regulating and maintenance services; and
• cultural services.
Provisioning services contribute to benefits extracted or harvested from ecosystems. Examples
are timber in a forest, freshwater from a river, and subsistence hunting. Regulating and
maintenance services result from the ability of ecosystems to regulate biological processes and
influence climate, hydrological, and biochemical cycles, thereby maintaining environmental
conditions beneficial to people. An example is the role of forests in preventing soil erosion.
Cultural services are the non-material benefits people (beneficiaries) obtain from ecosystems
through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation, and aesthetic
experiences. Examples are the recreational value of a forest and the cultural importance of a
heritage landscape for a local community.
Biodiversity plays an important role in maintaining the quality, quantity, and resilience of
ecosystem service flows, and it provides ecosystem services that beneficiaries rely upon now
and into the future. The diversity of genes, species, and ecosystems provides a greater range of
ecosystem service and higher overall quantity, quality, and resilience of ecosystem services and
improves the capacity of ecosystems to function effectively. A change in the state of biodiversity
can lead to changes in ecosystem services. This, in turn, can have an impact on the
beneficiaries of these ecosystem services. For example, a decline in the number of bees
caused by the organization’s activities can lead to decreased pollination services. If the crops
are not properly pollinated by the bees, the quality and quantity of the crops produced may be
affected, reducing the available food for the local community that grows the crops.
This disclosure gives insight into the ecosystem services and beneficiaries affected or
potentially affected by the organization’s activities. The organization should also list the
ecosystem services and beneficiaries affected or potentially affected by its suppliers’ activities
for each country or jurisdiction reported under 101-5-d and those affected or potentially affected
by the activities of its downstream entities.
For an example of how to present information on requirements in Disclosure 101-8, see Table 3
in the Appendix.
See references [31] and [54] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-8-a
Beneficiaries can include Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and other organizations. The
reporting organization can also be one of the beneficiaries. The organization can report the
number of beneficiaries when disclosing information for this requirement (e.g., 50 farmers
located in the area).
The organization should describe the approach used to identify the ecosystem services reported
under 101-8-a. The organization can explain if it engages with stakeholders to identify the
ecosystem services and beneficiaries affected. It can also use the following methodologies and
tools to identify ecosystem services:
• the ENCORE tool;
• the Natural Capital Protocol from the Natural Capital Coalition;
32 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
• the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) LEAP approach, which draws
on the UN SEEA Ecosystem Accounting;
• the World Resources Institute (WRI) Corporate Ecosystem Services Review.
See references [20], [32], [41], [54] and [56] in the Bibliography.
Guidance to 101-8-b
The organization’s activities may lead to an increase or decrease in the quality and quantity of
ecosystem services. For example, the organization can explain that cutting trees in the forest
has decreased food provisioning services, which has a negative impact on the local community
that needs to find an alternative food source. In another example, the organization can explain
that switching to agroforestry has resulted in an increase in soil erosion control services, which
has a positive impact on the local community that will face fewer risks from flooding.

Area Criteria*
Biodiversity Areas protected through legal or other effective means
importance
Geographically defined areas that are designated or regulated and managed to achieve specific
conservation objectives. They include:
• Protected areas [53]** (terrestrial, freshwater, and marine) according to local, national,
regional, or international conventions and agreements.
• Areas conserved through other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) [52].
Examples of protected areas and OECMs are Natural and mixed World Heritage sites [45],
Wetlands designated under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance
[34], and areas protected under regional seas agreements.
Areas scientifically recognized for their importance to biodiversity
• Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) [29]** – sites significantly contributing to global biodiversity in
terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. KBAs include Alliance for Zero Extinction
sites, Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, and Important Plant Areas.
• Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs) [12] – special areas in the
ocean supporting the healthy functioning of oceans and the many services they provide.
• Important Marine Mammal Areas [30].
Areas important for species
Areas important for species include areas with:
• threatened species [27]** (critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable at global,
national, or regional levels);
• congregatory species;
• migratory species;
• range-restricted species;
• endemic species.
Areas important for ecosystems
Areas important for ecosystems contain ecosystems that are rare or very localized, highly
threatened, important for ecosystem connectivity, or associated with key evolutionary
processes.
For example, coastal upwellings and seamounts.
Areas important for ecological connectivity
Areas important for ecological connectivity include important ecological corridors, areas and
routes important for seasonal migratory patterns, and areas that provide adaptive space for
species to spread across a landscape in the face of changing environmental conditions.
High ecosystem Areas of high ecosystem integrity, both on a global scale and in comparison to the surrounding
integrity landscape, contain significant opportunities for preserving environmental assets and
43 GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024
sustaining local and global ecosystem services.
Rapid decline in Areas of rapid decline in integrity are areas with declining resilience of ecosystem service

that have declined to a low state of integrity.
Ecosystem Examples of areas important for the delivery of ecosystem service benefits to Indigenous
service delivery Peoples, local communities, and other stakeholders include:
importance • areas in which healthy ecosystems and biodiversity support local livelihoods;
• areas that have been traditionally owned, occupied, or otherwise used or acquired by
Indigenous Peoples and local communities;
• areas of biocultural importance to Indigenous Peoples and local communities;
Ecosystem
service delivery • areas in which healthy ecosystems and biodiversity support recreational and cultural
services.
importance
(continued)
Examples of areas of importance to Indigenous Peoples and local communities are:
• Indigenous Peoples and Community Conserved Territories and Areas (ICCAs) [46];
• areas under customary management by Indigenous Peoples and local communities or
subject to customary harvest;
• FAO Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems [18] are agroecosystems inhabited by
communities that have intricate relationships with their territory.
Water physical Areas of known high physical water risk are areas with limited water availability, flooding, poor
risk quality of water, and marine areas with high levels of land-based pollution.
* Criteria for identifying ecologically sensitive areas are defined by the TNFD Guidance on the identification and
assessment of nature-related issues: The LEAP approach [41]. The WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter [57] can be used to
identify ecologically sensitive areas. The TNFD provides guidance on additional datasets that can be used to identify
these areas.
** The World Database on Protected Areas, the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, and the IUCN Red List of
Threatened Species can be accessed through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) [24] for identifying
protected areas, KBAs, and areas with threatened species respectively.

* If the organization uses polygon outlines or maps to report on the location of its sites, it can include a reference to
the polygon outlines or maps in the 'Location' row.
** The organization is required to report the distance only in cases where the ecologically sensitive areas are near its
sites.
*** The types of ecologically sensitive areas are: areas of biodiversity importance, areas of high ecosystem integrity,
areas of rapid decline in ecosystem integrity, areas of high physical water risks, and areas important for the delivery of
ecosystem service benefits to Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and other stakeholders.
**** The organization needs to report the information only for the direct drivers of biodiversity loss relevant to its
activities.
***** The organization should specify the unit of measurement used.
