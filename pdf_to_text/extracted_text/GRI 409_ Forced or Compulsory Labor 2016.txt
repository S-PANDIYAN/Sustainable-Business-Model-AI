Introduction
GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their
impacts related to forced or compulsory labor, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts
related to forced or compulsory labor.
• Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s impacts related to forced
or compulsory labor.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of forced or compulsory labor.
Not to be subjected to forced or compulsory labor is a fundamental human right. According to International Labour
Organization (ILO) Convention 29 ‘Forced Labour Convention’, forced or compulsory labor is defined as ‘all work or
service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not
offered himself voluntarily.'1
Forced and compulsory labor affects all world regions, countries, and economic sectors, and includes workers in
both formal and informal employment.2
Some of the most common forms of forced labor include forced labor in prisons (except for prisoners that have been
convicted in a court of law, and whose labor is under the supervision and control of a public authority), human
trafficking for the purpose of forced labor, coercion in employment, forced labor linked to exploitative labor contract
systems, and debt-induced forced labor, also known as ‘debt-bondage’ or ‘bonded labor’.3
The victims are most likely from groups subject to discrimination or performing work on an informal or precarious
basis. This can include women and girls forced into prostitution, migrants trapped in debt bondage, and sweatshop
or farm workers, among other groups.4
Due diligence is expected of an organization in order to prevent and combat all forms of forced or compulsory labor in
its activities. It is also expected to avoid contributing to or becoming linked to the use of forced or compulsory labor
through its relationships with others (e.g., suppliers, clients).
These concepts are covered in key instruments of the ILO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.

GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its impacts related to forced or compulsory labor. In addition to this Standard,
disclosures that relate to this topic can be found in GRI 408: Child Labor 2016.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined forced or compulsory labor to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s impacts related to forced or
compulsory labor (Disclosure 409-1).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
6 GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
7 GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016
1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined forced or compulsory labor to be a material topic is required to report how it
manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages forced or compulsory labor
REQUIREMENTS
using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
8 GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016
2. Topic disclosures
Disclosure 409-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for
incidents of forced or compulsory labor
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Operations and suppliers considered to have significant risk for incidents of forced or
compulsory labor either in terms of:
i. type of operation (such as manufacturing plant) and supplier;
ii. countries or geographic areas with operations and suppliers considered at risk.
b. Measures taken by the organization in the reporting period intended to contribute to the
elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor.
Guidance for Disclosure 409-1
GUIDANCE
The process for identifying operations and suppliers, as specified in Disclosure 409-1, can
reflect the reporting organization’s approach to risk assessment on this issue. It can also draw
from recognized international data sources, such as the ILO Information and reports on the
application of Conventions and Recommendations (see reference [1] in the Bibliography).
When reporting the measures taken, the organization can refer to the ILO ‘Tripartite Declaration
of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy’ and Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises for further guidance.
Background
Forced or compulsory labor exists globally in a variety of forms. The most extreme examples are
slave labor and bonded labor, but debts can also be used as a means of maintaining workers
in a state of forced labor. Indicators of forced labor can also include withholding identity papers,
requiring compulsory deposits, and compelling workers, under threat of firing, to work extra
hours to which they have not previously agreed.
Eliminating forced labor remains an important challenge. Forced labor is not only a serious
violation of a fundamental human right, it also perpetuates poverty and is a hindrance to
economic and human development.5
The presence and effective implementation of policies for eliminating all forms of forced or
compulsory labor are a basic expectation of responsible business conduct. Organizations with
multinational operations are required by law in some countries to provide information on their
efforts to eradicate forced labor in their supply chains.
