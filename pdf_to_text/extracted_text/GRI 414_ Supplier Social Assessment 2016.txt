Introduction
GRI 414: Supplier Social Assessment 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their
social impacts in their supply chain, and how they manage these impacts. The disclosures enable an organization to
provide information on its approach to preventing and mitigating negative social impacts in its supply chain.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its social
impacts in its supply chain.
• Section 2 contains two disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s supplier assessment and
social impacts in its supply chain.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing
this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of supplier social assessment.
An organization may be involved with negative social impacts either through its own activities or as a result of its
business relationships with other parties. Due diligence is expected of an organization in order to prevent, mitigate,
and address actual and potential negative social impacts in the supply chain. These include negative impacts the
organization either causes or contributes to, or that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its
relationship with a supplier.
These concepts are covered in key instruments of the United Nations: see the Bibliography.
Suppliers can be assessed for a range of social criteria, including human rights (such as child labor and forced or
compulsory labor); employment practices; health and safety practices; industrial relations; incidents (such as of
abuse, coercion or harassment); wages and compensation; and working hours. Some of these criteria are covered in
other GRI Topic Standards (e.g., GRI 401: Employment 2016, GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018, GRI
408: Child Labor 2016, GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016).
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
5 GRI 414: Supplier Social Assessment 2016
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its social impacts in its supply chain. In addition to this Standard, disclosures
that relate to this topic can be found in GRI 308: Supplier Environmental Assessment 2016.
If the reporting organization has determined both supplier social assessment and supplier environmental
assessment to be material, it can combine its disclosures for GRI 308 and GRI 414. For example, if the organization
uses the same approach for managing both topics, it can provide one combined explanation of how the organization
manages both topics.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined supplier social assessment to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s social impacts in its supply chain
(Disclosure 414-1 through Disclosure 414-2).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
6 GRI 414: Supplier Social Assessment 2016
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.

1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined supplier social assessment to be a material topic is required to report how it
manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages supplier social assessment
REQUIREMENTS
using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
The reporting organization can also disclose:
GUIDANCE
• the systems used to screen new suppliers using social criteria, and a list of the social
criteria used to screen new suppliers;
• processes used, such as due diligence, to identify and assess significant actual and
potential negative social impacts in the supply chain;
• how the organization identifies and prioritizes suppliers for assessment of social impacts;
• actions taken to address the significant actual and potential negative social impacts
identified in the supply chain and whether the actions are intended to prevent, mitigate, or
remediate the impacts;
• how expectations are established and defined in contracts with suppliers to promote the
prevention, mitigation, and remediation of significant actual and potential negative social
impacts, including targets and objectives;
• whether suppliers are incentivized and rewarded for the prevention, mitigation, and
remediation of significant actual and potential negative social impacts;
• practices for assessing and auditing suppliers and their products and services using social
criteria;
• a list of the type, system, scope, frequency, current implementation of assessment and audit,
and which parts of the supply chain have been certified and audited;
• the systems in place to assess the potential negative impacts of terminating a relationship
with a supplier as a result of assessing the supplier for social impacts, and the
organization’s strategy to mitigate those impacts.
Social criteria or assessments of suppliers for social impacts can include the topics covered in
other GRI Topic Standards (e.g., GRI 401: Employment 2016, GRI 403: Occupational Health and
Safety 2018, GRI 408: Child Labor 2016, GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016).
Negative impacts can include those that are either caused or contributed to by an organization,
or that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its relationship with a
supplier.
Assessments can be informed by audits, contractual reviews, two-way engagement, and
complaint and grievance mechanisms.
Actions taken to address social impacts can include changing an organization’s procurement
practices, adjusting performance expectations, capacity building, training, changes to
processes, as well as terminating supplier relationships.
Assessments and audits of suppliers and their products and services using social criteria can
be undertaken by an organization, by a second party, or by a third party.

social impacts with which improvements were agreed upon as a result of assessment.
e. Percentage of suppliers identified as having significant actual and potential negative
social impacts with which relationships were terminated as a result of assessment,
and why.
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 414-2, the reporting organization
RECOMMENDATIONS
should, where it provides appropriate context on significant impacts, provide a
breakdown of the information by:
2.1.1 the location of the supplier;
2.1.2 the significant actual and potential negative social impact.
Guidance for Disclosure 414-2
GUIDANCE
Negative impacts include those that are either caused or contributed to by an organization, or
that are directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its relationship with a supplier.
Assessments for social impacts can include the topics covered in other GRI Topic Standards
(e.g., GRI 401: Employment 2016, GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018, GRI 408:
Child Labor 2016, GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labor 2016).
Assessments can be made against agreed performance expectations that are set and
communicated to the suppliers prior to the assessment.
Assessments can be informed by audits, contractual reviews, two-way engagement, and
complaint and grievance mechanisms.
Improvements can include changing an organization’s procurement practices, the adjustment of
performance expectations, capacity building, training, and changes to processes.
Background
This disclosure informs stakeholders about an organization’s awareness of significant actual
and potential negative social impacts in the supply chain.
