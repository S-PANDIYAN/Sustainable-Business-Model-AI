Introduction
GRI 407: Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report
information about their impacts related to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and how they manage
these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts
related to freedom of association and collective bargaining.
• Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s impacts related to
freedom of association and collective bargaining.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of freedom of association and collective bargaining.
Freedom of association is a human right as defined by international declarations and conventions. In this context,
freedom of association refers to the right of employers and workers to form, to join and to run their own organizations
without prior authorization or interference by the state or any other entity.
The right of workers to collectively bargain the terms and conditions of work is also an internationally recognized
human right. Collective bargaining refers to all negotiations that take place between one or more employers or
employers' organizations, on the one hand, and one or more workers' organizations (e.g., trade unions), on the other,
for determining working conditions and terms of employment or for regulating relations between employers and
workers.1
These concepts are covered in key instruments of the International Labour Organization, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations: see the Bibliography.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.
1 This definition is based on the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 154, ‘Collective Bargaining Convention’, 1981.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its impacts related to freedom of association and collective bargaining. In
addition to this Standard, Disclosure 2-30 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 requires reporting on the percentage of
total employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined freedom of association and collective bargaining to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s impacts related to freedom of
association and collective bargaining (Disclosure 407-1).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
6 GRI 407: Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining 2016
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.

1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined freedom of association and collective bargaining to be a material topic is
required to report how it manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in
this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages freedom of association and

collective bargaining using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.

affect workers’ decisions to form or join a trade union, to bargain collectively or to engage
in trade union activities.

2. Topic disclosures
Disclosure 407-1 Operations and suppliers in which the right to
freedom of association and collective bargaining may be at risk
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Operations and suppliers in which workers’ rights to exercise freedom of association
or collective bargaining may be violated or at significant risk either in terms of:
i. type of operation (such as manufacturing plant) and supplier;
ii. countries or geographic areas with operations and suppliers considered at risk.
b. Measures taken by the organization in the reporting period intended to support rights to
exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining.
Guidance for Disclosure 407-1
GUIDANCE
The process for identifying operations and suppliers, as specified in Disclosure 407-1, can
reflect the reporting organization’s approach to risk assessment on this issue. It can also draw
from recognized international data sources, such as the various outcomes of the ILO
Supervisory bodies and the recommendations of the ILO Committee of Freedom of Association
(see reference [4] in the Bibliography).
When reporting the measures taken, the organization can refer to the ILO ‘Tripartite Declaration
of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy’ and Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises for further guidance.
Background
This disclosure concerns an organization’s due diligence with respect to any negative impacts
its activities have had on the human rights of workers to form or join trade unions and to bargain
collectively. This can include policies and processes with respect to the organization's business
relationships, including its suppliers. It can also include the due diligence process to identify
operations and suppliers where these rights are at risk.
It also aims to reveal actions that have been taken to support these rights across an
organization’s range of operations. This disclosure does not require the organization to express
a specific opinion on the quality of national legal systems.
Collective agreements can be made at the level of the organization, at the level of a particular
site, at the industry level, and at the national level in countries where this is the practice.
Collective agreements can cover specific groups of workers, for example, those performing a
specific activity or working at a specific location.
An organization is expected to respect the rights of workers to exercise freedom of association
and collective bargaining. It is also expected to not benefit from or contribute to such violations
through its business relationships (e.g., suppliers).
