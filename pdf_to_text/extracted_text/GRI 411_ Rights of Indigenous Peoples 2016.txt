Introduction
GRI 411: Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their
impacts related to the rights of indigenous peoples, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its impacts
related to the rights of indigenous peoples.
• Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s impacts related to the
rights of indigenous peoples.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing
this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the rights of indigenous peoples. While there is no universal definition of indigenous
peoples, they are generally identified as:1
• tribal peoples in independent countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from
other sections of the national community, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or
traditions or by special laws or regulations;
• peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the
populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of
conquest or colonization or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal
status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions.
Many indigenous peoples have suffered from historic injustices and therefore are considered a vulnerable group.
Such a group could experience negative impacts as a result of the organization’s activities more severely than the
general population.2
In addition to their collective rights, each person belonging to indigenous peoples shares universal human rights.
These concepts are covered in key instruments of the International Labour Organization and the United Nations: see
the Bibliography.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.

Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its impacts related to the rights of indigenous peoples.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined the rights of indigenous peoples to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s impacts related to the rights of
indigenous peoples (Disclosure 411-1).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
6 GRI 411: Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2016
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.

1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined the rights of indigenous peoples to be a material topic is required to report how it
manages the topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages the rights of indigenous
REQUIREMENTS
peoples using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
The United Nations (UN) Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the International
GUIDANCE
Labour Organization Convention 169 ‘Indigenous and Tribal Peoples’ address the rights of
indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples have both collective and individual rights, as set out in
these instruments.
The collective rights of indigenous peoples include, for example, the right to retain their own
customs and institutions, and the right to self-determination. According to the UN Declaration on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the right to self-determination enables indigenous peoples to
‘freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural
development’ and have the right to ‘autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their
internal and local affairs, as well as ways and means for financing their autonomous functions.’
Indigenous peoples also have the right to occupy and use their lands or territories, including
those who hold or use land pursuant to informal or customary rights. Indigenous peoples
cannot be relocated without free, prior, and informed consent. They also have the right to
redress in cases where their lands or resources have been occupied or damaged without their
free, prior, and informed consent.
Due diligence is expected of an organization in order to avoid infringing on the rights of
indigenous peoples through its activities. An organization is also expected to respect the rights
of indigenous peoples to free, prior, and informed consent in certain matters affecting them.
This is the case when, for example, an organization intends to start operations on land that is
inhabited or owned by indigenous peoples.

2. Topic disclosures
Disclosure 411-1 Incidents of violations involving rights of
indigenous peoples
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Total number of identified incidents of violations involving the rights of indigenous
peoples during the reporting period.
b. Status of the incidents and actions taken with reference to the following:
i. Incident reviewed by the organization;
ii. Remediation plans being implemented;
iii. Remediation plans that have been implemented, with results reviewed through
routine internal management review processes;
iv. Incident no longer subject to action.
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 411-1, the reporting organization
RECOMMENDATIONS
should include incidents involving the rights of indigenous peoples among:
2.1.1 workers performing the organization’s activities;
2.1.2 communities likely to be affected by existing or planned activities of the
organization.
Guidance for Disclosure 411-1
GUIDANCE
In the context of this disclosure, an ‘incident’ refers to a legal action or complaint registered with
the reporting organization or competent authorities through a formal process, or an instance of
non-compliance identified by the organization through established procedures. Established
procedures to identify instances of non-compliance can include management system audits,
formal monitoring programs, or grievance mechanisms.
Background
The number of recorded incidents involving the rights of indigenous peoples provides
information about the implementation of an organization’s policies relating to indigenous
peoples. This information helps to indicate the state of relations with stakeholder communities.
This is particularly important in regions where indigenous peoples reside, or have interests
near operations of the organization.
