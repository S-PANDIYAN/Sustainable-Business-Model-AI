Introduction
GRI 410: Security Practices 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their security
practice-related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its security
practice-related impacts.
• Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s security practice-related
impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists references used in developing this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of security practices. It focuses on the conduct of security personnel towards third
parties, and the potential risk for excessive use of force or other violations of human rights. Security personnel can
refer to employees of the reporting organization or employees of third-party organizations that provide security forces.
The use of security personnel can have negative impacts on local populations, and on the upholding of human rights
and the rule of law. Providing effective training in human rights therefore helps to make sure that security personnel
understand when to use force in an appropriate way, and how to ensure respect for human rights.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its security practice-related impacts.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined security practices to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s security practice-related impacts
(Disclosure 410-1).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).

Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.

1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined security practices to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the
topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages security practices using

Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.

2. Topic disclosures
Disclosure 410-1 Security personnel trained in human rights policies
or procedures
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Percentage of security personnel who have received formal training in the
organization’s human rights policies or specific procedures and their application to
security.
b. Whether training requirements also apply to third-party organizations providing security
personnel.
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 410-1-a, the reporting
RECOMMENDATIONS
organization should:
2.1.1 calculate the percentage using the total number of security personnel, whether
they are employees of the organization or employees of third-party organizations;
2.1.2 state whether employees of third-party organizations are also included in the
calculation.
Guidance for Disclosure 410-1
GUIDANCE
The training can refer either to training dedicated to the subject of human rights or to a human
rights module within a general training program. Training can cover issues such as the use of
force, inhuman or degrading treatment or discrimination, or identification and registering.
Background
The use of security personnel can play an essential role in allowing an organization to operate
in a safe and productive manner, and can contribute to the security of local communities and
populations.
However, as set out in the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers,
the use of security personnel can also have negative impacts on local populations and on the
upholding of human rights and the rule of law.
According to the UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, ‘human rights education
constitutes an essential contribution to the long-term prevention of human rights abuses and
represents an important investment in the endeavor to achieve a just society in which all human
rights of all persons are valued and respected.1
Training security personnel in human rights can therefore help to ensure their appropriate
conduct towards third parties, particularly regarding the use of force. This disclosure indicates
the proportion of the security force that can reasonably be assumed to be aware of an
organization’s expectations of human rights performance. Information provided under this
disclosure can demonstrate the extent to which management systems pertaining to human
rights are implemented.
