Note 1: On a species level, a significant impact causes a population decline or change in
distribution so that natural recruitment (reproduction or immigration from unaffected

engage in meaningful individual and collective actions that benefit people and
nature. Further:
• Socially equitable water use recognizes and implements the human right to

overturning, leakage, flow; breakage, bursting, splitting; loss of control, slipping,
stumbling and falling; body movement without stress; body movement under/with
stress; shock, fright; workplace violence or harassment (e.g., sexual harassment).
Note 2: An incident that results in injury or ill health is often referred to as an ‘accident’. An
incident that has the potential to result in injury or ill health but where none occurs is
often referred to as a ‘close call', ‘near-miss’, or ‘near-hit’.
work-related injury or ill health
negative impacts on health arising from exposure to hazards at work
Source: International Labour Organization (ILO), Guidelines on Occupational Safety and
Health Management Systems, ILO-OSH 2001, 2001; modified
Note 1: ‘Ill health’ indicates damage to health and includes diseases, illnesses, and
disorders. The terms ‘disease’, ‘illness’, and ‘disorder’ are often used
interchangeably and refer to conditions with specific symptoms and diagnoses.
Note 2: Work-related injuries and ill health are those that arise from exposure to hazards at
work. Other types of incident can occur that are not connected with the work itself.
For example, the following incidents are not considered to be work related:
• a worker suffers a heart attack while at work that is unconnected with work;
• a worker driving to or from work is injured in a car accident (where driving is not
part of the work, and where the transport has not been organized by the
employer);
• a worker with epilepsy has a seizure at work that is unconnected with work.
Note 3: Traveling for work: Injuries and ill health that occur while a worker is traveling are
work related if, at the time of the injury or ill health, the worker was engaged in work
activities ‘in the interest of the employer’. Examples of such activities include
traveling to and from customer contacts; conducting job tasks; and entertaining or
being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (at the direction of the
employer).
Working at home: Injuries and ill health that occur when working at home are work
related if the injury or ill health occurs while the worker is performing work at home,
and the injury or ill health is directly related to the performance of work rather than
the general home environment or setting.
Mental illness: A mental illness is considered to be work related if it has been
notified voluntarily by the worker and is supported by an opinion from a licensed
healthcare professional with appropriate training and experience stating that the
illness is work related.
