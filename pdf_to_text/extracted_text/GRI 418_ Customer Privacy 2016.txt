Introduction
GRI 418: Customer Privacy 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their impacts
related to customer privacy, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its customer
privacy-related impacts.
• Section 2 contains one disclosure, which provides information about the organization’s customer privacy-related
impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of customer privacy, including losses of customer data and breaches of customer
privacy. These can result from non-compliance with existing laws, regulations and/or other voluntary standards
regarding the protection of customer privacy.
These concepts are covered in key instruments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development:
see the Bibliography.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its impacts related to customer privacy.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined customer privacy to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s customer privacy-related impacts
(Disclosure 418-1).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).

Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.

1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined customer privacy to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the
topic using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages customer privacy using
REQUIREMENTS
Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
8 GRI 418: Customer Privacy 2016
2. Topic disclosures
Disclosure 418-1 Substantiated complaints concerning breaches of
customer privacy and losses of customer data
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Total number of substantiated complaints received concerning breaches of customer
privacy, categorized by:
i. complaints received from outside parties and substantiated by the organization;
ii. complaints from regulatory bodies.
b. Total number of identified leaks, thefts, or losses of customer data.
c. If the organization has not identified any substantiated complaints, a brief statement of
this fact is sufficient.
Compilation requirements
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 418-1, the reporting
organization shall indicate if a substantial number of these breaches relate to events
in preceding years.
Background
GUIDANCE
Protection of customer privacy is a generally recognized goal in national regulations and
organizational policies. As set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, organizations are
expected to ‘respect consumer privacy and take reasonable measures to ensure the security of
personal data that they collect, store, process or disseminate’.
To protect customer privacy, an organization is expected to limit its collection of personal data, to
collect data by lawful means, and to be transparent about how data are gathered, used, and
secured. The organization is also expected to not disclose or use personal customer
information for any purposes other than those agreed upon, and to communicate any changes
in data protection policies or measures to customers directly.
This disclosure provides an evaluation of the success of management systems and procedures
relating to customer privacy protection.
