Introduction
GRI 415: Public Policy 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their public policy-
related impacts, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
• Section 1 contains a requirement, which provides information about how the organization manages its public
policy-related impacts.
• Section 2 contains two disclosures, which provides information about the organization’s public policy-related
impacts.
• The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
• The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments used in developing this Standard.
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses the topic of public policy. This includes an organization’s participation in the development of
public policy, through activities such as lobbying and making financial or in-kind contributions to political parties,
politicians, or causes.
While an organization can positively support the public political process and encourage the development of public
policy that benefits society at large, this can also bring risks associated with corruption, bribery, and undue influence,
among others.
These concepts are covered in key instruments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development:
see the Bibliography.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its public policy-related impacts.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined public policy to be a material topic:
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Any disclosure from this Topic Standard that is relevant to the organization’s public policy-related impacts
(Disclosure 415-1).
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).

Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
7 GRI 415: Public Policy 2016
1. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined public policy to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic
using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section).
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
1.1 The reporting organization shall report how it manages public policy using Disclosure
REQUIREMENTS
3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
1.2 The reporting organization should report:
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.2.1 the significant issues that are the focus of its participation in public policy
development and lobbying;
1.2.2 its stance on these issues, and any differences between its lobbying positions
and any stated policies, goals, or other public positions.
8 GRI 415: Public Policy 2016
2. Topic disclosures
Disclosure 415-1 Political contributions
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
REQUIREMENTS
a. Total monetary value of financial and in-kind political contributions made directly and
indirectly by the organization by country and recipient/beneficiary.
b. If applicable, how the monetary value of in-kind contributions was estimated.
Compilation requirements
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 415-1, the reporting
organization shall calculate financial political contributions in compliance with
national accounting rules, where these exist.
Background
GUIDANCE
The purpose of this disclosure is to identify an organization’s support for political causes.
This disclosure can provide an indication of the extent to which an organization’s political
contributions are in line with its stated policies, goals, or other public positions.
Direct or indirect contributions to political causes can also present corruption risks, because
they can be used to exert undue influence on the political process. Many countries have
legislation that limits the amount an organization can spend on political parties and candidates
for campaigning purposes. If an organization channels contributions indirectly through
intermediaries, such as lobbyists or organizations linked to political causes, it can improperly
circumvent such legislation.
