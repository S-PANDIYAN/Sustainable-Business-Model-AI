Goals (SDGs) by 2030, progress has been deeply inadequate. This reflects
not just implementation challenges, but also a fundamental problem in how
we measure, monitor and respond to global development needs. Tracking
SDG progress and course-correcting in real time depends entirely on robust
data infrastructure. Yet statistical systems remain chronically underfunded
– treated as technical afterthoughts rather than foundational investments.
Without reliable data, Governments cannot identify problems early, allocate
resources effectively or demonstrate accountability.

tensions and climate shocks – the demand for timely, inclusive and
integrated data has never been greater. Yet, paradoxically, just as these
data needs intensify, funding for statistical systems faces unprecedented
uncertainty. Recent disruptions, from the termination of major survey
programmes to reduced development assistance, expose the risks of
building data infrastructure on unstable financial ground.
Data funding faces an uncertain future
According to The PARIS21 Partner Report on Support to Statistics 2024, International funding for data and statistics, by funding sources, 2015–2022
between 2015 and 2022, international financial support to data increased (millions of dollars)

• Global health progress is slowing after decades of gains. Between 2000
and 2019, maternal and child mortality declined significantly; the HIV
incidence rate fell; and healthy life expectancy increased by over five
years. However, COVID-19 reversed some of these gains, cutting life
expectancy by 1.8 years and slowing progress towards nearly all health-
related SDG targets.
• Infectious and non-communicable diseases remain major threats. AIDS-
related deaths have halved since 2010, and 54 countries have eliminated

rising; tuberculosis returned to being probably the world’s leading cause

• Climate change is accelerating, with 2024 marking the hottest year on
record, at approximately 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. Extreme
weather is intensifying, driving the highest climate-related displacement
in 16 years and worsening food insecurity, economic losses and
instability. Although one year above 1.5°C does not mean the Paris
Agreement has been breached, it serves as a clarion call for increasing
ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade, as current global
efforts fall far short of what is needed.
• The upcoming global climate summit is a critical opportunity to
course-correct, by advancing recently agreed climate finance goals,
strengthening multilateral cooperation and delivering ambitious national
climate plans across all sectors to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. • The world cannot and must not let up on climate action. To keep the

The use of geographic regions as the basis for country groupings is a major
change from The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2016 and the progress
reports on the Millennium Development Goals. Previously, data were
presented for countries in “developed” and “developing” regions, which
were further broken down into geographic subregions. Although there is no
established convention for the designation of “developed” and “developing”
countries or areas in the United Nations system, data for some indicators
in this report are still being presented for developed and developing regions
and countries for the purpose of statistical analysis only, and are based on
the practice employed by the international agencies that provided the data.
